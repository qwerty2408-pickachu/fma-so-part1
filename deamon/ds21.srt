Rui: Since the day I was born,

21
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,061
I've always been very frail.

22
00:01:37,297 --> 00:01:39,231
I couldn't run.

23
00:01:39,366 --> 00:01:42,301
Even just walking
was a struggle for me.

29
00:01:56,583 --> 00:01:58,584
I'll save you
from this harsh life.

30
00:02:04,324 --> 00:02:06,492
Rui: My parents
weren't happy about it.

31
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:12,397
Since I'd acquired
a strong body,

32
00:02:12,533 --> 00:02:15,467
I could never
expose myself to sunlight,

33
00:02:15,602 --> 00:02:17,335
and of course...

34
00:02:17,337 --> 00:02:19,204
I had to devour humans.

35
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,477
Father: What have you done?

36
00:02:25,612 --> 00:02:27,812
What on earth
have you done, Rui?

37
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:29,048
Answer me!

( Mother sobbing )

39
00:02:36,557 --> 00:02:40,426
Rui: Long ago,
I heard a wonderful story.

40
00:02:43,764 --> 00:02:45,698
There was once a Father who died

41
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:48,267
trying to save
his drowning child.

42
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:51,636

( Wailing )

44
00:02:54,975 --> 00:02:57,309
Rui: I was deeply moved.

45
00:02:57,444 --> 00:03:02,381
Such astounding display
of parental love, a true bond.

46
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:03,848
This Father who drowned

47
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:06,318
had fulfilled his role
as a guardian wonderfully,

48
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:11,123
but I wasn't bestowed
the same kind of devotion.

49
00:03:11,258 --> 00:03:13,425
( Father crying )

50
00:03:17,932 --> 00:03:20,532
Rui: When it came
to my own parents,

51
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:23,335
they tried to kill me.

52
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:24,336
( Mother crying )

53
00:03:24,471 --> 00:03:25,804
Rui: All my Mother did was cry,

54
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:29,241
never lifting a finger
to protect me.

55
00:03:33,347 --> 00:03:34,546
( Squelch )

56
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:45,624
They must have been imposters.

57
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:50,462
Our bond wasn't the genuine one
at all, I thought.

58
00:03:52,967 --> 00:03:55,567
Mother: I'm...Sorry.

59
00:03:57,638 --> 00:04:00,438
Rui: She's saying something.

60
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,307
I thought she was dead.

61
00:04:02,309 --> 00:04:04,709
Mother: I'm sorry...

62
00:04:04,845 --> 00:04:08,513
That I couldn't give you
a strong, healthy body.

63
00:04:08,649 --> 00:04:10,115
( Rui gasps )

64
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,250
( Narrating ) Those...

65
00:04:12,386 --> 00:04:15,788
Were the last words
my Mother ever spoke to me.

66
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:17,189
She was dead.

67
00:04:19,193 --> 00:04:21,393
Father: Rui, listen.

68
00:04:21,528 --> 00:04:23,696
We're going to die with you!

69
00:04:25,332 --> 00:04:28,333
Rui: I was so enraged
he had tried to kill me,

70
00:04:28,335 --> 00:04:31,603
the meaning
of his words escaped me.

71
00:04:31,738 --> 00:04:34,339
But I came to realize
soon after

72
00:04:34,475 --> 00:04:36,608
he intended
to atone on my behalf

73
00:04:36,743 --> 00:04:39,144
for the sin
of having killed someone,

74
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,580
in the form
of taking his own life.

75
00:04:47,754 --> 00:04:50,422
It was a genuine bond,

76
00:04:50,557 --> 00:04:54,193
and that night, I had severed it
with my own two hands.

77
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:57,830
After all that, however,

78
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:01,033
master Muzan gave me
words of encouragement.

79
00:05:02,436 --> 00:05:04,503
Kibutsuji: It was
all your parents's fault

80
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:07,572
for refusing to accept you
for who you are.

81
00:05:07,574 --> 00:05:09,408
Take pride in your own power.

82
00:05:10,845 --> 00:05:15,380
Rui: I had no other choice
but to see it that way.

83
00:05:15,382 --> 00:05:17,683
I couldn't bear
the weight of what I'd done.

84
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:20,352
( Sobs )

85
00:05:21,856 --> 00:05:25,290
I knew that I only
had myself to blame.

86
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,134
Every single day,

87
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:40,672
I missed my parents so much,
I could barely stand it.

88
00:05:40,807 --> 00:05:44,276
Even after crafting
a family of my own,

89
00:05:44,411 --> 00:05:45,677
that emptiness remained.

90
00:05:45,812 --> 00:05:48,747
Because I was the strongest,

91
00:05:48,749 --> 00:05:52,551
I couldn't depend on anyone
to protect me, no one.

92
00:05:53,754 --> 00:05:55,687
The more powerful I became,

93
00:05:55,822 --> 00:05:59,358
the more distant my memories
of being human became as well.

94
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:02,094
I began losing sight

95
00:06:02,229 --> 00:06:04,363
of what it was I wanted
in the first place.

96

¶

97
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:17,842
I sought out a bond that I was
never able to claim for myself,

98
00:06:17,844 --> 00:06:21,447
not in my old life,
nor the new one I created.

( Tanjiro gasps )

100
00:06:32,927 --> 00:06:36,128
This body is giving off a scent,

101
00:06:36,263 --> 00:06:39,431
one of grief too overwhelming
for him to bear.

Hands as gentle as sunbeams.

00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:08,693
I remember now, clear as day.

106
00:07:08,695 --> 00:07:10,562
I had wanted to apologize.

107
00:07:11,766 --> 00:07:13,766
I'm sorry.

108
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,033
I was...

109
00:07:15,169 --> 00:07:17,202
I was to blame for everything.

110
00:07:19,173 --> 00:07:21,006
I hope you can forgive me.

111
00:07:22,376 --> 00:07:25,644
I've killed
so many people, though.

112
00:07:25,646 --> 00:07:28,614
Surely I'm going to hell,
aren't I?

113
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:32,785
Father, Mother...

114
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:35,688
I can't go to the same place
as you, can I?

115
00:07:37,391 --> 00:07:39,158
Father: That's not true.

116
00:07:41,395 --> 00:07:45,063
We'll be together,
no matter where you go.

All of it was my fault.

Tomioka: Don't waste
your sympathy.

133
00:08:47,794 --> 00:08:49,327
It was a Demon.

134
00:08:49,463 --> 00:08:52,797
The fact it looked like a child
makes no difference.

135
00:08:52,933 --> 00:08:57,335
It lived for decades,
terrorizing our people.

136
00:08:57,471 --> 00:08:58,803
Tanjiro: If it's for the sake

137
00:08:58,805 --> 00:09:01,139
of avenging those
who were killed,

138
00:09:01,141 --> 00:09:04,142
to make sure
there are no more victims,

139
00:09:04,144 --> 00:09:06,278
I won't hesitate

140
00:09:06,413 --> 00:09:09,147
to bring my blade down
on any Demon's neck.

141
00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:12,150
But when it comes to those
who felt despair and regret

142
00:09:12,152 --> 00:09:14,086
from the actions
they took as a Demon,

143
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:16,188
I will never disrespect them!

144
00:09:17,892 --> 00:09:20,025
Because at one time
or another...

145
00:09:21,428 --> 00:09:24,763
They were human,
no different from me!

146
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:27,633
So please don't step
on his remains!

147
00:09:29,436 --> 00:09:31,770
They're not hideous monsters
at all.

148
00:09:31,772 --> 00:09:35,507
Instead, demons are
hopeless creatures,

00:10:44,611 --> 00:10:47,412
after a mere glance
at this situation.

169
00:10:47,548 --> 00:10:49,348
She's truly amazing.

170
00:10:50,684 --> 00:10:52,417
As is he.

171
00:10:52,553 --> 00:10:55,154
Kakushi 1: That boy? How so?

172
00:10:55,288 --> 00:10:57,422
Kakushi 2: He defeated
that Demon, which in turn,

173
00:10:57,558 --> 00:11:00,025
slowed the circulation
of the poison just a bit.

174
00:11:01,695 --> 00:11:03,562
Kakushi 1: All right!
This should do it!

175
00:11:04,765 --> 00:11:06,297
We're in good shape.

176
00:11:06,433 --> 00:11:08,233
Looks like
they'll all pull through.

177
00:11:08,235 --> 00:11:09,901
Kakushi 2: That's good.

178
00:11:09,903 --> 00:11:12,171
I'd like to wrap things up
as quickly as possible

179
00:11:12,305 --> 00:11:14,305
and leave this place.
Wouldn't you?

180
00:11:14,307 --> 00:11:15,707
Kakushi 1: No argument here.

181
00:11:15,709 --> 00:11:18,577
This mountain has
a really hideous stench to it.

182
00:11:18,712 --> 00:11:20,579

00:11:27,588 --> 00:11:30,723
Shinobu: Now then, Tomioka,
would you please move?

185
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:34,526
Tomioka: I don't--

186
00:11:34,528 --> 00:11:37,196
I don't think I'm disliked.

187
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:38,364
( Tanjiro gasps )

188
00:11:39,933 --> 00:11:43,402
Shinobu: Oh, dear.
I do apologize.

189
00:11:43,537 --> 00:11:46,071
You're only just hearing
about this now, then?

190
00:11:46,207 --> 00:11:49,375
I'm sorry. I didn't mean
for you to find out this way.

191
00:11:50,744 --> 00:11:52,177
( Tanjiro yells )

00:11:53,346 --> 00:11:54,679
( Groans )

193
00:11:54,681 --> 00:11:57,016
- Shinobu: Boy!
- Tanjiro: Yes, ma'am!

194
00:11:57,150 --> 00:12:00,085
Shinobu: What you're protecting
there is actually a Demon,

195
00:12:00,221 --> 00:12:02,421
so please move away
before you get hurt.

196
00:12:02,556 --> 00:12:04,289
Tanjiro: No. You're mistaken!

197
00:12:04,425 --> 00:12:06,558
Well, you're not mistaken,

198
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,160
but she's my little sister!

199
00:12:09,296 --> 00:12:11,430
She's my sister,
and that's why...

200
00:12:11,565 --> 00:12:14,566
Shinobu: Oh, my.
Is that really true?

201
00:12:14,701 --> 00:12:16,501
You poor thing.

202
00:12:16,637 --> 00:12:19,638
In that case,
so she won't suffer,

203
00:12:19,773 --> 00:12:22,908
I'll use a gentle toxin
in order to kill her.

204
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:24,910
( Tanjiro gasps )

205
00:12:24,912 --> 00:12:26,612
Tomioka: Can you move?

206
00:12:28,249 --> 00:12:31,450
Even if it's difficult,
you need to go.

207
00:12:31,585 --> 00:12:33,518
Take your sister, and run.

208
00:12:33,654 --> 00:12:35,154
Tanjiro: Tomioka...

209
00:12:36,257 --> 00:12:37,522
Thank you.

210
00:12:37,524 --> 00:12:39,124
I appreciate this!

211
00:12:41,394 --> 00:12:42,527
Shinobu: Did you...

212
00:12:42,529 --> 00:12:44,529
Just break
the rules of the corps?

213
00:12:44,665 --> 00:12:47,532

214
00:12:47,668 --> 00:12:49,501
( Tanjiro panting )

215
00:12:55,809 --> 00:12:59,077
My whole body is aching so much,
I wanna scream,

216
00:12:59,212 --> 00:13:02,281
but I have to keep going
and endure it!

217
00:13:02,415 --> 00:13:05,684
Endure! Endure! Endure! Endure!

218
00:13:05,819 --> 00:13:07,586
( Nezuko sighing )

219
00:13:09,623 --> 00:13:11,156
Tanjiro: Does this mean...

220
00:13:11,158 --> 00:13:13,692
I'm gonna have to leave
the Demon Slayer Corps?

221
00:13:13,827 --> 00:13:15,694
Even if she's my sister,
there's no way

222
00:13:15,829 --> 00:13:18,530
they'd let one of their
swordsmen travel with a Demon!

223
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:26,237
Shinobu: I see you're
dead serious about this.

224
00:13:26,373 --> 00:13:29,141
Who would have thought a Hashira
would defend a Demon?

225
00:13:32,513 --> 00:13:34,379
Whatever your intentions are,

226
00:13:34,515 --> 00:13:36,247
I'm afraid
I don't feel like playing

227
00:13:36,249 --> 00:13:38,249
this game of stalling for time,

228
00:13:38,251 --> 00:13:40,719
and so good day to you.

229
00:13:42,389 --> 00:13:44,123

¶

231
00:13:51,665 --> 00:13:54,533
Shinobu: Is this your attempt
at catching up with me?

232
00:13:57,404 --> 00:13:58,404
( Giggles )

233
00:14:02,743 --> 00:14:06,011
I don't have any objections
to you trying to stop me,

234
00:14:06,147 --> 00:14:08,981
but don't forget there's
someone else to watch out for.

235
00:14:16,557 --> 00:14:18,157
Tanjiro: Don't stop running!

236
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:19,624
Keep on moving!

237
00:14:19,626 --> 00:14:22,261
You gotta run
as far away as you can!

238
00:14:25,298 --> 00:14:26,565
( Groans )

239
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:32,103
Damn it! What just happened?

240
00:14:32,239 --> 00:14:34,840
I wasn't aware
of my surroundings.

241
00:14:34,842 --> 00:14:35,708
Nezuko!

242
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:38,510
A Demon Slayer?

243
00:14:41,915 --> 00:14:43,182
( Grunts )

244
00:14:44,651 --> 00:14:46,451
Get out of here, Nezuko!

245
00:14:46,587 --> 00:14:48,587
Run away as fast as you can!

246
00:14:48,722 --> 00:14:51,290
Don't get caught,
no matter what! Hurry!

¶

248
00:15:01,735 --> 00:15:04,269
Slayer: Did she
just shrink into a child?

249
00:15:13,747 --> 00:15:15,280
She's just running away

250
00:15:15,416 --> 00:15:18,283
without even
throwing out an attack. Why?

251
00:15:18,419 --> 00:15:21,152
( Nezuko panting )

252
00:15:21,154 --> 00:15:23,354
Slayer: Well, it doesn't matter.

253
00:15:23,356 --> 00:15:25,491
My orders
are to slay this Demon.

254
00:15:29,563 --> 00:15:31,296
Shinobu: Tomioka...

255
00:15:31,298 --> 00:15:33,832
There's something I want to say.

256
00:15:33,967 --> 00:15:37,368
Since the purpose of my attack
was to slay a Demon,

257
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:38,770
it certainly
wouldn't be construed

258
00:15:38,772 --> 00:15:40,639
as a violation of the corps,

259
00:15:40,774 --> 00:15:44,576
but what you're doing
is clearly against the rules.

260
00:15:44,711 --> 00:15:47,646
You're preventing me
from slaying a Demon.

261
00:15:47,781 --> 00:15:49,715
What are your intentions here?

262
00:15:52,986 --> 00:15:56,187
Don't you have
anything to say for yourself?

263
00:15:56,323 --> 00:15:57,723
This will be your final warning.

264
00:15:57,858 --> 00:16:00,225
At least give me
some sort of reason.

265
00:16:06,467 --> 00:16:09,334
Tomioka: As I recall,
it was two years ago.

266
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:12,404
Shinobu: Are you about
to go into a long-winded story

267
00:16:12,539 --> 00:16:15,206
from the past just to spite me?

268
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:18,744
It's because of what I said
to you earlier. Is that it?

269
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:20,279
( Tomioka groans )

Kasugai:
Message! Message! ( Caws )

272
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:29,488
I have a message
from headquarters!

273
00:16:29,623 --> 00:16:33,292
Tanjiro and Nezuko
are to be taken into custody

274
00:16:33,427 --> 00:16:35,094
and brought back
to headquarters!

Kasugai: Tanjiro
and the Demon Nezuko

278
00:16:40,367 --> 00:16:43,635
are to be taken into custody and
brought back to headquarters!

279
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:46,838
Kasugai 2: Tanjiro,
dressed in a checkered haori,

280
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:49,108
with a scar on his forehead!

281
00:16:49,242 --> 00:16:53,178
Nezuko, a Demon girl
with a bamboo muzzle!

282
00:16:53,314 --> 00:16:55,581
Slayer: Are you Nezuko?

283
00:16:59,586 --> 00:17:03,254
Kasugai 1: Bring them back!
Bring them back! ( Caws )

Tanjiro,

Kakushi 2: He does have a scar.

290

Kakushi 1: All right,
let's bring him in.

291
00:17:21,608 --> 00:17:25,344
Kakushi 2: Look. His jawbone
seems to be broken, doesn't it?

292
00:17:25,478 --> 00:17:28,380
( Kakushi 1 sighs )
I feel bad about tying him up.

294

Wh-who the hell is this?

295
00:17:34,421 --> 00:17:37,488
Kakushi 4: I don't know.
A Demon? No, it couldn't be.

296
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:39,558
Kakushi 3: Is it human?

297
00:17:39,693 --> 00:17:41,627
Kakushi 4: He's wearing
our uniform trousers.

298
00:17:42,896 --> 00:17:43,762
Kakushi 3: Oh, wait.

299
00:17:43,897 --> 00:17:46,431
This is a mask. He is human!

300
00:17:46,567 --> 00:17:48,900
Kakushi 4: All right,
let's bring him in.

301

Kakushi 3: Ah, this guy's
been beaten up really bad.

302
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,140
Kakushi 4: Why's he
strung up like this?

303
00:17:57,911 --> 00:18:01,112
Inosuke: There was
nothing I could do.

304
00:18:01,114 --> 00:18:05,584
On my own, I couldn't
bring down even a single Demon.

305
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,520
You know what?

306
00:18:08,655 --> 00:18:10,989
Maybe I'm not that strong.

Zenitsu:
They wrapped US all up, huh?

309
00:18:23,537 --> 00:18:25,604
Who are these people?

310
00:18:25,739 --> 00:18:29,208
They seem to be cleaning up
this place really efficiently.

311
00:18:29,342 --> 00:18:31,342
And that girl there,

312
00:18:31,344 --> 00:18:34,079
isn't she the girl
from final selection?

313
00:18:34,215 --> 00:18:35,814
She has the same kind
of hair ornament

314
00:18:35,949 --> 00:18:37,416
as the lady who wrapped US up.

315

Kakushi 5: Should we
bring them as well?

316

Slayer: Yes,
go to the Butterfly Mansion.

317
00:18:43,757 --> 00:18:45,690
I'll be hunting down
the demons here,

318
00:18:45,826 --> 00:18:47,626
so you can rest easy.

319

Zenitsu: I think
I've heard of these guys.

320

They're called the Kakushi.

321
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:54,633
They clean up the aftermath

322
00:18:54,768 --> 00:18:57,302
of the corps's
battles with demons.

323
00:18:57,304 --> 00:18:59,571
I've heard
that most of their members

324
00:18:59,706 --> 00:19:02,541
are people whose sword skills
aren't quite as polished.
