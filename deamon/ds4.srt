( Women vocalizing )

10
00:01:35,962 --> 00:01:38,497
Tanjiro: There's a reason I won,

11
00:01:38,565 --> 00:01:41,867
because I learned how
to detect the opening thread.

12
00:01:44,905 --> 00:01:49,374
As soon as I pick up the scent,
I'm able to see the thread.

13
00:01:49,443 --> 00:01:51,510
It guides me.

( Thread rings )

15
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:57,582
It connects my blade to
any opening the enemy leaves me,

16
00:01:57,584 --> 00:01:59,718
and it tightens
as soon as I see it.

17
00:02:06,727 --> 00:02:09,461
It quickly draws
my blade forward.

18
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:11,463
Then I strike.

19
00:02:11,532 --> 00:02:13,432

Urokodaki: To be honest,
I never had any intention

24
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:42,827
of sending you
to the final selection.

( Tanjiro gasps )

26
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:48,500
Urokodaki: Because I didn't want
to see any more children die.

27
00:02:48,569 --> 00:02:51,035
I was sure you wouldn't be able

to cut through
this Boulder, but...

29
00:02:57,978 --> 00:03:00,512
Well done, Tanjiro.

30
00:03:00,581 --> 00:03:03,515
Truly remarkable.

31
00:03:03,584 --> 00:03:05,918

36
00:03:16,931 --> 00:03:19,598

There's so much food.
What's the deal?

40
00:03:35,082 --> 00:03:37,082
Urokodaki:
You finished your training,

41
00:03:37,151 --> 00:03:38,683
so we're celebrating.

42
00:03:38,685 --> 00:03:41,019
Time to eat. Don't be shy.

43

( Tanjiro chuckles )

44
00:03:42,489 --> 00:03:43,722
Thank you. I'm starving.

45
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:50,429
Urokodaki: Tanjiro...

46
00:03:50,497 --> 00:03:54,032
I'm afraid there's nothing more
I can do for you.

47
00:03:54,101 --> 00:03:58,903
After today, you will be facing
unimaginable hardships.

48
00:03:58,973 --> 00:04:01,440
Your training
pales in comparison.

49
00:04:01,508 --> 00:04:03,642
But, at least for tonight,

50
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:08,013
you can rest well
and sleep soundly one last time.

( Snipping continues )

53
00:04:24,465 --> 00:04:26,865
Hey, Tanjiro.

54
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:28,534
Tanjiro: Eh? Yes?

55
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:32,471
Urokodaki: What did
you think of the hot pot?

56
00:04:32,539 --> 00:04:36,074
Tanjiro: Great! I haven't
feasted like that in a while.

57
00:04:36,142 --> 00:04:39,411
Urokodaki: A growing boy
with an appetite like yours

58
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:42,881
will get bigger and stronger,
the bigger his meals are.

59
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:46,485
The same applies to demons.

60
00:04:46,553 --> 00:04:48,687
Remember that.

61
00:04:48,755 --> 00:04:50,622
The more humans
a Demon has eaten,

62
00:04:50,691 --> 00:04:52,891
the more powerful he'll be.

63
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:56,428
Tanjiro: So, if they eat a lot,
they'll be tough to defeat?

64
00:04:56,497 --> 00:04:58,697
Urokodaki: That's right.

65
00:04:58,765 --> 00:05:01,900
They get stronger,
physical traits change,

66
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:04,670
and some learn
to use strange spells.

67
00:05:10,577 --> 00:05:11,844
You'll be able to tell

68
00:05:11,912 --> 00:05:13,912
how many poor souls
they've claimed

69
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,448
once your sense of smell
is even more developed.

70
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:21,786
Tanjiro: What's this?

71
00:05:21,856 --> 00:05:24,589
It is called a warding mask.

72
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:27,192
It's been enchanted
by a protection spell

73
00:05:27,261 --> 00:05:29,594
to keep you from harm.

74
00:05:29,596 --> 00:05:31,830
Tanjiro: Now it makes sense.

75
00:05:35,602 --> 00:05:37,369
( Birds chirping )

00:06:01,828 --> 00:06:03,495
Tanjiro: Nezuko.

I promise.
I'm going to come back for you.

78
00:06:15,109 --> 00:06:18,176
Urokodaki: No need
to worry about your sister.

79
00:06:18,245 --> 00:06:20,845
I'll take good care
of her for you.

80
00:06:20,915 --> 00:06:23,382
Tanjiro: Thanks for everything.

81
00:06:26,186 --> 00:06:28,654
Guess I'm off. See you later!

82
00:06:34,595 --> 00:06:36,729
Say hi to Sabito and Makomo!

83
00:06:36,797 --> 00:06:38,130
Urokodaki: Eh?

84
00:06:38,198 --> 00:06:42,000
Tanjiro? That's impossible.

85
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:45,604
How does he know
the names of the dead?

( Women vocalizing )

87

Tanjiro: Wisteria.

It's all over the place.

89
00:07:00,554 --> 00:07:03,555

it was out of season.

you've come to enter

00:07:42,729 --> 00:07:45,263
the Demon Slayer Corps's
final selection.

96
00:07:45,332 --> 00:07:47,732
Thank you all for being here.

97
00:07:47,734 --> 00:07:51,203
Guide: Here on mount fujikasane,
there are several demons

98
00:07:51,271 --> 00:07:54,606
that were captured alive
by Demon Slayer swordsmen.

99
00:07:54,675 --> 00:07:57,209
They are kept here
for this event.

100
00:07:57,277 --> 00:08:00,278
Guide 2: The Wisteria blossoms
prevent them from leaving.

101
00:08:00,347 --> 00:08:03,148
They bloom
on this mountain year-round,

102
00:08:03,217 --> 00:08:06,751
and they cover everything from
the base to halfway to the top.

103
00:08:06,753 --> 00:08:09,621
Guide 1:
But the Wisteria ends here,

104
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:12,157
so demons abound
from this point on,

105
00:08:12,226 --> 00:08:13,958
and they're very hungry.

106
00:08:14,028 --> 00:08:17,362
Guide 2: In order
to complete final selection,

107
00:08:17,364 --> 00:08:19,698
you must survive for seven days

108
00:08:19,766 --> 00:08:22,367
beyond the Wisteria's
protection.

109

Survive.

114
00:08:42,189 --> 00:08:44,023
Don't think about anything else.

115
00:08:47,928 --> 00:08:50,328
I just have to make it
through the night.

116
00:08:50,397 --> 00:08:51,864
Once the sun comes up,

117
00:08:51,932 --> 00:08:53,732
the demons
won't be able to do anything.

118
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,068
That'll be my chance to rest.

119
00:08:56,136 --> 00:08:58,670
Which means
I need to head east,

120
00:08:58,739 --> 00:09:01,674
make my way to where
the sunlight will hit first.

( Gasps )

122

Where is it?

Where's it coming from?

127
00:09:21,295 --> 00:09:23,695
I can't seem to pin it down.

128

Demon 1: Damn you!

00:09:45,852 --> 00:09:48,386
Why don't you
go find your own snack?

137
00:09:48,455 --> 00:09:50,054
This is my turf!

138

Ah, go to hell!

Demon 1: I saw him first!

00:09:57,798 --> 00:09:58,863
Demon 2: Doesn't matter!

143
00:09:58,865 --> 00:10:00,398
I'll be the first to kill him!

Calm down, and watch closely.

Don't forget your training.

Demon 2: Haven't tasted
human flesh in forever!

149

Tanjiro: Total concentration.

150
00:10:17,084 --> 00:10:18,150
Water breathing!

Fourth form!

155
00:10:30,831 --> 00:10:32,497
Striking tide!

156

( Tanjiro panting )

158
00:10:41,776 --> 00:10:43,107
I did it.

159
00:10:43,109 --> 00:10:45,310
( Flesh crackling )

160
00:10:45,379 --> 00:10:47,312
I killed demons.

161
00:10:47,381 --> 00:10:49,782
I'm getting stronger!

162
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:52,517
So my training
wasn't for nothing.

163
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:54,420
I did master it.

164
00:11:02,262 --> 00:11:03,462
Nothing's left behind

165
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:05,530
when a Demon's killed
with this sword,

166
00:11:05,532 --> 00:11:08,132
not even the bones.

167
00:11:08,134 --> 00:11:10,202
( Birds chirping )

168
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:12,805
Urokodaki: A Demon's
weakest at the neck.

169
00:11:12,873 --> 00:11:17,942
However, a normal sword
is useless, even upon the neck.

170
00:11:17,944 --> 00:11:21,079
Tanjiro: Okay.
So how do I kill them?

171
00:11:21,148 --> 00:11:23,882
Tanjiro:
With a Demon Slayer's katana

172
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:26,284
forged by
a special type of steel.

173
00:11:26,353 --> 00:11:29,488
That's the only weapon
that can kill a Demon.

174
00:11:29,556 --> 00:11:33,926
It's called a nichirin sword.

175
00:11:35,162 --> 00:11:36,929
( Flesh crackling )

176
00:11:41,235 --> 00:11:42,901
Tanjiro: Rest in peace.

177
00:11:45,572 --> 00:11:46,571
( Sniffs )

178
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,841
( Gags ) What the--

179
00:11:48,909 --> 00:11:50,308
what's that awful smell?

180
00:11:50,377 --> 00:11:52,044
( Boy screams )

181
00:11:52,112 --> 00:11:53,311
What the hell?!

182
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:54,880
I didn't sign up for this!

183
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:57,182
Tanjiro: What?

184
00:11:57,184 --> 00:11:58,150
( Gasps )

185
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:05,024
( Rustling )

186
00:12:09,196 --> 00:12:12,131
My god. What is that?

187
00:12:16,103 --> 00:12:18,303
Makomo: Hey, Sabito.

188
00:12:18,372 --> 00:12:22,041
You think Tanjiro can beat him?

189
00:12:23,911 --> 00:12:25,777
Sabito: I don't know.

190
00:12:25,846 --> 00:12:29,915
It seems nothing's
ever going to be enough.

191
00:12:29,983 --> 00:12:33,185
You saw for yourself,
didn't you?

192
00:12:34,388 --> 00:12:36,288
( Boy panting )

193
00:12:38,792 --> 00:12:41,326
What's this mutated Demon
doing here?

194
00:12:41,395 --> 00:12:42,795
Nobody said anything!

195
00:12:44,198 --> 00:12:45,998
( Demon growling )

196
00:12:49,203 --> 00:12:51,003
( Women vocalizing )

197
00:12:52,206 --> 00:12:54,173
( Tanjiro shudders )

198
00:12:57,878 --> 00:13:00,812
( Demon groans )

199
00:13:00,881 --> 00:13:01,813
( Boy gasping )

200
00:13:01,882 --> 00:13:03,148
Tanjiro: Swallowed whole!

201
00:13:03,217 --> 00:13:05,017
( Demon gobbling )

202
00:13:07,221 --> 00:13:09,988
( Growling )

203
00:13:13,227 --> 00:13:15,827
( Boy gasping )

204
00:13:15,896 --> 00:13:16,929
No!

205
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:20,165
( Chorus vocalizing )

206
00:13:25,239 --> 00:13:27,172
( Screams )

207
00:13:27,241 --> 00:13:28,974
( Tanjiro gasps )

208
00:13:29,043 --> 00:13:29,975
Stay strong!

209
00:13:30,044 --> 00:13:32,778
Save him. Save him. Save him.

210
00:13:32,846 --> 00:13:35,113
You're not powerless anymore!

211
00:13:35,182 --> 00:13:36,115
Move it!

212
00:13:37,384 --> 00:13:40,252
Water breathing, second form!

213
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,387
Water wheel!

214
00:13:43,523 --> 00:13:44,456
( Boy grunts )

215
00:13:46,126 --> 00:13:48,060
( Demon grunts )

216
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:52,530
Well, look at that.

217
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:55,467
It's another one
of those sweet little foxes.

218
00:13:55,535 --> 00:13:57,002
Tanjiro: "Another"?

219
00:13:57,071 --> 00:14:00,205
Say, fox cub, the year?

220
00:14:00,274 --> 00:14:02,007
Are we still in meiji?

221
00:14:02,075 --> 00:14:03,275
( Tanjiro gasps )

222
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:05,343
It's the taisho period!

223
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:08,180
Demon: Taisho?

224
00:14:09,817 --> 00:14:12,951
( Screams )

225
00:14:12,953 --> 00:14:14,953
Already?!

226
00:14:14,955 --> 00:14:17,956
We have passed
into a new period?!

227
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:19,357
Again!

228
00:14:19,426 --> 00:14:23,361
And I'm still stuck
inside this Wisteria prison!

229
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:24,496
( Screams )

230
00:14:24,564 --> 00:14:27,565
Unforgivable! Unforgivable!

231
00:14:27,567 --> 00:14:30,368
Damn you, Urokodaki!

232
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:32,570
Damn you! Damn you! Damn you!

233
00:14:32,572 --> 00:14:34,440
Tanjiro: You know Urokodaki?

234
00:14:34,508 --> 00:14:37,175
Demon: Of course I do.
Urokodaki's the one

235
00:14:37,244 --> 00:14:39,511
who captured me
and brought me here!

236
00:14:39,579 --> 00:14:42,180
But that was 47 years ago now,

237
00:14:42,182 --> 00:14:45,517
back when he was
still hunting demons like me,

238
00:14:45,585 --> 00:14:48,586
the edo period,
during the keio era.

239
00:14:48,588 --> 00:14:50,922
Tanjiro: No way. Edo period?

240
00:14:50,991 --> 00:14:52,257
Boy: You lie!

241
00:14:52,326 --> 00:14:55,127
No Demon could ever live
that long in here!

242
00:14:55,195 --> 00:14:59,197
Besides, all these demons have
only eaten two or three humans!

243
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:01,599
They die during final selection.

244
00:15:01,601 --> 00:15:04,202
In fact, they even
eat their own kind!

245
00:15:04,204 --> 00:15:08,606
Demon: And yet I've managed
to survive here all this time,

246
00:15:08,676 --> 00:15:11,009
trapped in this flowery cage.

247
00:15:11,078 --> 00:15:15,213
I've managed to devour
at least 50 of you brats.

248
00:15:15,215 --> 00:15:16,682
Tanjiro: 50 people?!

249
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:19,084
Demon: 11...

250
00:15:19,153 --> 00:15:20,285
12...

251
00:15:20,354 --> 00:15:23,088
13.

252
00:15:23,157 --> 00:15:26,091
That means you're number 14.

253
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,625
Tanjiro: What are
you talking about?

254
00:15:27,695 --> 00:15:29,627
( Demon giggles )

255
00:15:29,629 --> 00:15:32,498
That's how many of Urokodaki's
students I've eaten.

256
00:15:32,566 --> 00:15:34,232
( Laughs )

257
00:15:34,301 --> 00:15:38,103
I promised myself i'd
kill every single one of them.

258
00:15:38,172 --> 00:15:40,372
- ( Tanjiro gasps )
- Demon: You know,

259
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:44,442
the ones who stood out to me
the most were those two.

260
00:15:44,512 --> 00:15:46,444
Ah, yes.

261
00:15:46,514 --> 00:15:50,048
The boy's hair
was an unusual shade of pink,

262
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:51,583
a scar by his mouth.

263
00:15:51,651 --> 00:15:54,452
He was the most powerful
of the lot.

264
00:15:54,522 --> 00:15:59,191
The other one was a girl
who wore a flowery kimono,

265
00:15:59,259 --> 00:16:03,061
small, not much power,
but awfully agile.

266
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:04,262
( Tanjiro gasps )

267
00:16:04,331 --> 00:16:06,264
So they were dead?

268
00:16:06,266 --> 00:16:08,133
Killed by this Demon?

269
00:16:08,202 --> 00:16:09,601
But I was with them.

270
00:16:09,669 --> 00:16:12,338
Demon: Your mask,
that's what gives you away

271
00:16:12,406 --> 00:16:15,207
as one of Urokodaki's brats.

272
00:16:15,275 --> 00:16:19,677
Easy to spot the texture
of one of the masks he's carved.

273
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:24,216
They always match the style
of the tengu mask he wears.

274
00:16:24,284 --> 00:16:26,552
He calls them "warding masks,"
right?

275
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:29,421
Except that's
how I pick out who to eat.

276
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:31,957
They're all inside my belly.

277
00:16:32,025 --> 00:16:35,026
It's as if he's guided them
to their deaths.

278
00:16:35,095 --> 00:16:37,229
( Giggles )

279
00:16:37,297 --> 00:16:38,564
When I told the girl,

280
00:16:38,632 --> 00:16:41,366
she started crying
and fell into a rage.

281
00:16:41,435 --> 00:16:43,435
( Laughs )

282
00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:44,570
But it wasn't long

283
00:16:44,638 --> 00:16:47,105
before she lost
all control of her movement.

284
00:16:47,107 --> 00:16:48,306
( Laughs )

285
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:51,643
I ripped her limb from limb
and feasted!

286
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:53,779
( Tanjiro growls )

287
00:16:53,847 --> 00:16:55,314
( Demon growls )

00:16:56,984 --> 00:16:59,050
( Tanjiro yells )

289
00:16:59,119 --> 00:17:01,319
Sabito: Calm down, Tanjiro.

290
00:17:01,321 --> 00:17:03,521
Your breathing is uneven.

291
00:17:03,591 --> 00:17:06,258
Stay focused. Forget about US.

292
00:17:16,136 --> 00:17:18,270
( Boy gasping )

293
00:17:18,338 --> 00:17:20,005
You're on your own, buddy.

294
00:17:20,074 --> 00:17:21,306
I'm getting out of here.

295
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:24,309
( Women vocalizing )

296
00:17:28,748 --> 00:17:30,516
( Demon laughing )

297
00:17:32,752 --> 00:17:35,621
There goes another one
of Urokodaki's brats.

298
00:17:35,689 --> 00:17:37,089
( Giggles )

299
00:17:38,292 --> 00:17:40,092
I wonder, how will he feel

300
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,161
when another one of his children
doesn't make it back home?

301
00:17:43,163 --> 00:17:45,631
Oh, I wish I could see
the look on his face.

302
00:17:45,699 --> 00:17:47,299
( Laughs )

303
00:17:47,367 --> 00:17:50,302
I bet it's
going to be priceless.

304
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:51,704
If only I could be there.

305
00:17:54,775 --> 00:17:57,109
( Shigeru faintly ) Tanjiro!

306
00:17:57,177 --> 00:17:58,777
Tanjiro!

307
00:17:58,846 --> 00:18:00,712
Tanjiro!

308
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:01,580
( Tanjiro gasps )

309
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:06,718
Demon: What's this?
He can still move.

310
00:18:06,787 --> 00:18:09,455
That means I can have some fun!

311
00:18:09,523 --> 00:18:11,290
¶

312
00:18:16,263 --> 00:18:18,664
Tanjiro: Damn!
I can't just cut his arms off.

313
00:18:18,732 --> 00:18:20,866
They regrow too fast!

314
00:18:20,934 --> 00:18:22,734
Demon: That's not
going to be enough

315
00:18:22,802 --> 00:18:24,870
for you to beat me,
little fox.

316
00:18:24,938 --> 00:18:28,540
But, then again,
not even that pink-haired brat

317
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:30,209
could cut off my head!

318
00:18:38,285 --> 00:18:39,118
( Tanjiro growls )

319
00:18:41,421 --> 00:18:44,089
There's no way
I can just let him go.

320
00:18:44,158 --> 00:18:47,693
I won't let another life
be sacrificed.

321
00:18:47,761 --> 00:18:50,628
No more! I'll take him down!

322
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:53,365
( Yelling )

323
00:18:53,433 --> 00:18:54,632
( Sniffs )

324
00:18:54,702 --> 00:18:56,635
Wait a second. Underground!

325
00:19:01,575 --> 00:19:03,308
Demon: H-he jumped!

326
00:19:03,377 --> 00:19:04,776
Damn it, how did he know?

327
00:19:04,845 --> 00:19:06,444
No matter.

328
00:19:06,514 --> 00:19:09,281
He won't be able
to dodge an attack in midair!

329
00:19:11,318 --> 00:19:14,920
Makomo: Do you think
he's going to beat Tanjiro, too?

330
00:19:14,988 --> 00:19:17,589
His neck is thick.
Can it be cut?

331
00:19:19,527 --> 00:19:22,794
Sabito: I can't say
whether he'll win or lose today.

332
00:19:22,863 --> 00:19:26,799
However, one fact
is irrefutable either way.

333
00:19:29,002 --> 00:19:33,805
Tanjiro cut
through this Boulder,

334
00:19:33,874 --> 00:19:36,809
the toughest
and largest Boulder of them all.

335
00:19:40,548 --> 00:19:42,081
Demon: He deflected it!

336
00:19:43,217 --> 00:19:45,283
( Tanjiro yells )

337
00:19:45,285 --> 00:19:46,418
Total concentration.

338
00:19:46,486 --> 00:19:48,220
- ( Inhales )
- Water breathing!

339
00:19:49,857 --> 00:19:52,157

340
00:19:53,493 --> 00:19:55,827
Demon: I let him get too close.

341
00:19:55,896 --> 00:19:58,764
Not to worry. My neck is tough.

342
00:19:58,832 --> 00:20:00,498
He can't cut through it.

343
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,767
Tanjiro: First form!

344
00:20:01,835 --> 00:20:03,701
Demon: As soon as he fails,

345
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:06,572
I'm going to grab his head
and crush it,

346
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,706
just like I did
to the other one!

347
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:10,508
( Thread rings )

348
00:20:10,578 --> 00:20:11,910
( Chorus vocalizing )

349
00:20:11,912 --> 00:20:14,546
( Tanjiro yells )

350
00:20:16,516 --> 00:20:18,450
( Demon grunts )

351
00:20:18,518 --> 00:20:20,352
Tanjiro: Water surface slash!

352
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:24,623
( Singing in Japanese )

352
00:20:25,305 --> 00:21:25,404
