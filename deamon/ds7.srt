EPISODE 7:
MUZAN KIBUTSUJI

3
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,510
Nezuko!

4
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:47,930
Don't chase after him!

5
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:49,560
Get back here!

6
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:52,060
Come to me.

7
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:58,780
Nezuko!

8
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:10,000
Mr. Urokodaki did tell me...

9
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:12,960
that Nezuko is a demon now.

10
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:19,590
And that she's not necessarily so weak
that I have to protect her.

11
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:23,930
Is it all right to let her handle this?

12
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:28,600
If I have her watch over those two,
I can focus on my attacks.

13
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:43,950
Nezuko!

14
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:51,330
Nezuko!

15
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:52,960
I'm going underground!

16
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:55,290
I want you to protect those two!

17
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,340
You can do that, right?

18
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:31,410
Inside a swamp...

19
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:34,710
And these are...

20
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:45,220
Are these the clothes and belongings
of the people who were kidnapped?

21
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:51,560
Just look at all the innocent people
they've murdered!

22
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:53,390
It's unforgivable!

23
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:57,020
Unforgivable!

24
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:03,690
Getting hard to breathe, brat?

25
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:06,660
There's hardly any air inside this swamp.

26
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:12,080
On top of that, the darkness coiling
around your body must feel pretty heavy.

27
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:17,330
You can't move the way you would
aboveground! Serves you right!

28
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:21,460
You should've looked
before you leaped in, you damn fool!

29
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:35,600
Don't underestimate me!

30
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:39,270
Just where do you think
I got my training anyway?

31
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:44,070
The air was thinner on top of Mt. Sagiri!

32
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:52,950
Not to mention...

33
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:58,040
there are moves that only unleash
their full potential underwater!

34
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:12,810
So, they can move at angles
like that inside this swamp?

35
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,850
But it doesn't matter!

36
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:18,480
All I have to do is slash
when they get near enough to attack!

37
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:22,440
The form that can be utilized
even when there's no sure footing...

38
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:26,740
Generating a powerful vortex

39
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:29,280
with a violent twist
of my upper and lower body!

40
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:41,000
Here comes the scent!

41
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:42,040
The opening thread!

42
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,000
Total Concentration!

43
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,210
Water Breathing!

44
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:48,220
Sixth Form!

45
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:51,550
Whirlpool!

46
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,210
I can't breathe!

47
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:26,840
I gotta get out of here!

48
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:30,590
Nezuko!

49
00:07:57,990 --> 00:07:59,790
This girl is powerful!

50
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,710
She doesn't seem to have mastered
any morphing skills yet,

51
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:08,840
but look how strong she is anyway!

52
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:13,510
She must have gotten
a huge amount of blood from him!

53
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:23,350
She moves so fast!
I can't dive back into the swamp!

54
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:24,940
But hey,

55
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:28,940
I'm getting used
to these one-note attacks of hers!

56
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:36,200
Even if she kicks my head clean off...

57
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:38,740
Even if my internal organs explode,

58
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,040
demons can regenerate in a flash!

59
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:52,420
All right!

60
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:56,390
Now I'm gonna drill a hole
right through your face!

61
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:04,980
Hands off my sister!

62
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:21,330
Did I just get taken out?

63
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:24,960
Both of my other selves
got taken out by this guy!

64
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:33,340
You give off a scent like rotten oil.

65
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:35,720
It's a horrible smell!

66
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:39,010
How many people have you killed?

67
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:40,970
Listen!

68
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:45,680
If women live any longer,
they turn ugly and start tasting like crap!

69
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,810
So, we killed them for their own good!

70
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:52,360
You should be thankful to us demons—

71
00:09:58,450 --> 00:09:59,820
Never mind.

72
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:10,670
You're going to tell me
what you know about Muzan Kibutsuji.

73
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:28,690
Talk to me!

74
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:32,020
Start talking!

75
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:35,230
I-I can't tell you.

76
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,200
I can't tell you!

77
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:49,040
DEMON SLAYER:
KIMETSU NO YAIBA

78
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:53,040
DEMON SLAYER:
KIMETSU NO YAIBA

79
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:56,460
I can't tell you!

80
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:02,680
I can't tell you!

81
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,470
You mustn't tell.

82
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:12,060
You mustn't tell anyone about me.

83
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:17,940
If you do tell anyone,
I'll know right away.

84
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:20,990
I'm always watching you.

85
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:25,160
I can't tell you!

86
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:27,080
I can't tell you!

87
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:30,460
I can't tell you! I can't tell you!
I can't tell you!

88
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:32,670
The smell of fear is strong.

89
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:34,710
He's trembling
all the way down to his bones!

90
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:39,300
I can't tell you, all right?

91
00:11:56,610 --> 00:11:59,570
Once again, I failed
to get any information.

92
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,080
Nezuko!

93
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:15,960
She's asleep.

94
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:18,170
She stopped bleeding, too.

95
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:20,760
So, she's sleeping in order to recover?

96
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:29,180
Sorry. I'm so sorry.

97
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,930
Wait just a little longer, okay?

98
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:35,230
I promise to turn you
back into a human again!

99
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,090
Mr. Kazumi?

100
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:03,720
Are you all right?

101
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,930
I've lost my fiancée.

102
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:11,890
How can I be all right?

103
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,690
Mr. Kazumi...

104
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:23,940
No matter how many people
you may lose,

105
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:26,240
you have no choice but to go on living.

106
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:29,580
No matter how devastating
the blows may be.

107
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:34,080
What do you know about it?

108
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:36,000
A kid like you?

109
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:57,520
I'll be on my way now.

110
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:02,020
Take this.

111
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:08,780
I hope you'll find something
of Miss Satoko's in there.

112
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:33,140
So, you went through the same thing, too?

113
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:35,310
Is that it?

114
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:40,560
I...

115
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:42,230
I'm sorry!

116
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:44,020
That was an awful thing to say!

117
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:46,070
Please forgive me!

118
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:48,570
I'm so sorry!

119
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:56,450
His hand was heart-breaking to see.

120
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:59,080
Hardened by relentless training
and so thick.

121
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,840
It wasn't a boy's hand.

122
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,090
I'm leaving that young woman
in your hands!

123
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:11,970
All right!

124
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:14,890
All right!

125
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:31,860
It's not just me.

126
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:37,870
How many people have you killed,
tortured and tormented?

127
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:41,250
Muzan Kibutsuji,

128
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:45,380
I'll never forgive you as long as I live!

129
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:57,560
Next up, Asakusa, Tokyo!

130
00:15:57,810 --> 00:16:00,770
Rumors of a demon lurking there!

131
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:04,810
I'm heading to my next mission already?

132
00:16:04,810 --> 00:16:06,940
Oh yes, you are!

133
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,030
Hold on a minute.

134
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,820
No can do!

135
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:15,320
Come on, just give me
a minute! Hold on! What?

136
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:15,320
Just shut up and go already!

137
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:41,810
Are the cities this advanced now?
It's nighttime, but it's so bright out!

138
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,110
The buildings are so tall!

139
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,700
What is this?

140
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:56,200
The cities...

141
00:16:56,490 --> 00:16:57,990
The cities...

142
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:10,090
I feel dizzy.

143
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,930
Uh, let's go that way, Nezuko!

144
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:19,970
I-I beg your pardon!

145
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:37,490
UDON

146
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:40,990
Excuse me.

147
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:44,750
A bowl of udon
with grated yam on top please.

148
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,580
Uh, sure thing!

149
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:56,590
I've never been to a place like this.

150
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,720
It's way too crowded.

151
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:09,980
Here's your udon with grated yam on top!

152
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:12,110
Thank you very much.

153
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:48,980
This scent!

154
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,690
Why would I catch it here all of a sudden?

155
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:01,410
It's the same scent
that was left in my house!

156
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:07,330
Muzan Kibutsuji!

157
00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:13,840
Is this the guy giving off that scent?

158
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:29,980
It's him!

159
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,560
Daddy?

160
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:38,570
Who's that?

161
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:42,360
He's...

162
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:42,990
It's all right.

163
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:43,700
He's...

164
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,530
Don't worry.

165
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:44,950
He's...

166
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,950
He's living here,
pretending to be a human!

167
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:53,580
Is there something I can do for you?

168
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:57,130
You seem to be quite flustered.

169
00:19:57,710 --> 00:19:59,590
Oh my. What's going on?

170
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:01,430
Mother!

171
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:12,140
They're humans!

172
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:15,020
The girl and the woman...

173
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:16,650
Their scent is human!

174
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,360
Don't you know?

175
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:22,530
Can't you tell?

176
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:25,320
That this guy is a demon?

177
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:28,120
That he devours humans?

178
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:31,250
Do you know him?

179
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:33,250
No.

180
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:36,130
Much to my consternation,

181
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:39,760
I've never seen this child before.

182
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:46,600
He must have mistaken me
for someone else.

183
00:20:46,930 --> 00:20:48,850
Oh, you think so?

184
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,320
Dear, what's the matter?

185
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,490
Dear?

186
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:12,080
Stop!

187
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:16,000
PREVIEW

188
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:16,000
RUSTLE RUSTLE

189
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,360
I've finally tracked down Muzan Kibutsuji!

190
00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:07,740
If I can bring him down,
then Nezuko can be human again!

191
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:12,990
Still, everyone in Asakusa
sure is stylish, huh?

192
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:16,000
I bet you'd look great
in an outfit like that!

193
00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:19,000
Now, it's time for a Taisho secret!

194
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:22,380
Yutaka from the udon shop
was born and raised in Asakusa.

195
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:26,260
He makes udon in Asakusa
because he loves Asakusa so much, I hear.

196
00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:29,180
A suit, huh?

197
00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:31,090
Now I feel kind of grown-up!

198
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:33,550
I'd better get back to my mission!

199
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:36,890
Next, Episode 8,
"The Smell of Enchanting Blood"!

200
00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:40,020
TO BE CONTINUED
