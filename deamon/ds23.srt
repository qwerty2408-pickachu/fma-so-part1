1
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:06,980
Come on out, demon!

2
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:09,480
Stop it!

3
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:12,860
Look, it's the human blood
you love so much!

4
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:19,870

EPISODE 23:
HASHIRA MEETING

7
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:12,440
What's the matter, demon? Come on!

8
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:14,190
You know you want it.

9
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:25,370
Iguro, you're digging into him too hard.

10
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:27,450
Ease up a bit please.

11
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,170
I'm only holding him down
because he's trying to move.

12
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:34,590
Kamado,

13
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:38,470
if you use any breathing techniques
while your lungs are being squeezed,

14
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:40,260
your veins will burst.

15
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,640
His veins will burst!

16
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:44,180
I like it! Sounds flamboyant!

17
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,560
Come on! Start bursting!

18
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,350
Poor soul...

19
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:54,650
Such a weak, pathetic child.

20
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:57,650
Namu Amida Butsu.

21
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,420
Kamado?

22
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:20,220
DESTROY

23
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,800
Nezuko!

24
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:36,940
She's my sister!

25
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:38,900
She's my younger sister!

26
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:40,820
Nezuko is different!

27
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,910
Though I don't know how it happened!

28
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,600
All humans are your family.

29
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:20,730
Protect humans.

30
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:33,210
Humans are to be protected and saved.

31
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:34,750
Never hurt them.

32
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,090
I will never hurt them.

33
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:04,240
What just happened?

34
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:07,780
The demon girl turned her back in disgust.

35
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:10,830
Although she'd been stabbed
three times by Shinazugawa,

36
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,660
and despite his flaunting
of his bloody arm in her face,

37
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:16,370
she restrained herself and did not bite.

38
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:24,510
So now, it's been proven
that Nezuko won't attack humans, right?

39
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:31,600
What do you think you're doing, Tomioka?

40
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:33,890
Tanjiro...

41
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:40,520
I'm sure that even after this,
there are some who can't accept Nezuko.

42
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:44,530
You must prove it to them starting now.

43
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:49,070
That you and Nezuko can fight
as Demon Slayers.

44
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:51,370
That you can be useful.

45
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:57,160
What is this feeling?

46
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:59,290
It's like I'm floating.

47
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,170
His voice...

48
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:05,970
Is it because of this man's voice
that I'm feeling light in the head?

49
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:09,840
Go out and defeat a Twelve Kizuki.

50
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:12,680
Do that, and you'll be accepted by all.

51
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:16,230
And it will give more weight to your words.

52
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:22,310
I...

53
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:26,740
Nezuko and I will defeat Muzan Kibutsuji!

54
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,280
Nezuko and I will do it for sure!

55
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:32,620
Strike with the sword
that will stop the chain of grief!

56
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:37,410
As you're ill-equipped to do so
right now, Tanjiro,

57
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:40,370
let's start by defeating
a Twelve Kizuki, all right?

58
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:42,960
Yes, sir.

59
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:46,760
You mustn't laugh!
You mustn't, you mustn't, you mustn't!

60
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:49,430
It goes without saying

61
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,850
that the Hashiras of the Demon Slayer Corps
have phenomenal skills.

62
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:57,980
After training themselves to death,
they have defied death,

63
00:06:58,230 --> 00:07:00,940
and they've also defeated Twelve Kizukis.

64
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,060
A good attitude to have!

65
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:08,110
That is why Hashiras receive
respect and preferential treatment.

66
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:12,070
So, Tanjiro, mind your manners
when you speak.

67
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:14,450
Y-Yes, sir!

68
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,370
One more thing. Sanemi...

69
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,120
Obanai...

70
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:23,710
Don't torment the younger ones too much.

71
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:25,750
As you wish.

72
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:30,340
As you wish.

73
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:34,260
Tanjiro, we have concluded
our business with you.

74
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,510
You may step back.

75
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:43,270
In that case, allow me
to take Kamado into my house.

76
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:50,320
All right, then!
Take them away please!

77
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:57,910
Pardon me for cutting in front of you!

78
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:57,910
KAKUSHI

79
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:13,130
Now then, let us begin the Hashira Meet—

80
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:16,470
Hold on a second!

81
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:16,470
Come back here!

82
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:23,560
Please allow me to head-butt
that man covered in scars!

83
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:24,900
I gotta—

84
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:26,610
Shut up! Keep your mouth shut!

85
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:29,820
I gotta head-butt him as many times
as he stabbed Nezuko!

86
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:33,200
Head-butting isn't a violation
of the Corps rules, right?

87
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,320
Shut up! Settle down now!

88
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:38,080
- Let go of me!
- Cut it out!

89
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:49,090
You're not allowed to interrupt the Master.

90
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:52,760
- We beg your pardon!
- We beg your pardon, Master!

91
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,590
- Master Tokito!
- We beg your pardon!

92
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:56,220
We beg your pardon!

93
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:59,560
We assure you that this boy
will be severely reprimanded, so—

94
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:58,050
Muichiro!

95
00:08:58,050 --> 00:08:59,810
What a fine boy!

96
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,600
So please! Please!

97
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:01,600
So cool!

98
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:03,520
Just get out of our sight.

99
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,980
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

100
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:09,570
Tanjiro...

101
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:12,990
Give Miss Tamayo my regards.

102
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:18,450
Hold up a second!

103
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:20,870
I just heard him
mention Miss Tamayo's name!

104
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,870
Don't you say another word!

105
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:27,290
- We got yelled at because of you!
- I thought I'd pee my pants!

106
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,920
You don't know
how terrifying the Hashiras are!

107
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,510
Try to read the room! Read it!

108
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,130
- I'll never forgive you as long as I live!
- I'll never forgive you!

109
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:39,390
- Apologize!
- Apologize! Apologize!

110
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,510
I...

111
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,180
I'm sorry.

112
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:48,100
DEMON SLAYER:
KIMETSU NO YAIBA

113
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:52,110
DEMON SLAYER:
KIMETSU NO YAIBA

114
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:55,440
Hello! Is anyone home?

115
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,490
Hello! Is anyone home?

116
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:00,990
Hello...

117
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:05,370
Jeez, no one's coming to the door.

118
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,370
Let's go check out the yard.

119
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:13,500
Hey, walk on your own.

120
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:15,670
I'm sorry.

121
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,800
It's just that my whole body
is aching like crazy.

122
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,560
The headquarters was huge, too,

123
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:26,980
but this mansion's something else, huh?

124
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:33,900
Come to think of it, was this place
called the "Butterfly Mansion"?

125
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,660
Hey, there's someone.

126
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:43,910
Someone's here.

127
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,660
That would be, um...

128
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:50,330
Oh, right! The Tsuguko...

129
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,630
Her name is...

130
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:54,000
Tsuguko?

131
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,300
It's Master Kanao Tsuyuri.

132
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:06,180
It's the girl from Final Selection.

133
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:12,230
Hey, somebody's forgotten how they got
stomped on by Master Kanao last night.

134
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:17,530
A Tsuguko is a swordsman
trained by a Hashira.

135
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:21,030
Only the ones with mind-blowing
skills and talent get chosen.

136
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:23,780
She's a girl, but she's awesome!

137
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:28,500
Please forgive us, Master Tsuyuri.

138
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,460
We were ordered to come here
by Master Kocho.

139
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,130
Permission to enter the mansion?

140
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,390
Uh, do you mind?

141
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,270
You don't mind, do you?

142
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:52,060
And who are you?

143
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:56,110
- Uh...
- We were ordered by Master Kocho!

144
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:58,530
Are you a Kakushi?

145
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:00,320
You've brought an injured person, right?

146
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:02,320
Please come this way.

147
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:04,320
Uh, right!

148
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:05,950
She's fast!

149
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:15,710
Five times?

150
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,210
I gotta take this five times? A day?

151
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:21,050
And I have to keep taking
this medicine for three months?

152
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:23,550
If I take this, I can't eat
anything, you know!

153
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:27,600
I mean it's really bitter!
It's such an ordeal!

154
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:31,600
So, you mean my arms and legs will heal
just by taking medicine? For real?

155
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:36,480
Listen, are they really gonna heal?
Tell me how they're gonna get healed!

156
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:34,850
Please stop shouting, will you?

157
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,320
Somebody explain this to me better!

158
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:41,070
So, that guy is still making
a commotion.

159
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,530
What's gonna happen if I forget
to take it even once? Hey!

160
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:44,110
Listen! My arms and legs!
What's gonna happen to my arms and legs? Hey!

161
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:48,490
What's gonna happen if I forget
to take it? Hey! Hey! Hey!

162
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:46,740
Zenitsu!

163
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:50,240

7 days' worth
After each meal

164
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:49,080
Please try to be quiet!

165
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:52,750
Didn't we already explain it
to you numerous times?

166
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,670
If you don't stop this nonsense now,
we'll tie you up!

167
00:12:58,290 --> 00:12:59,550
Really now!

168
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:03,010
Zenitsu!

169
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:06,890
Are you okay? Did you hurt yourself?

170
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:09,390
So you did come up the mountain after all!

171
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:13,270
T-Tanjiro...

172
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:18,810
Tanjiro! Listen to me, will you?

173
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:23,900
I got stung by this stinky spider,
and the poison hurt like crazy, okay?

174
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:30,450
And that girl's been yelling at me
all this time! I hate my life!

175
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,870
Hey, get away from me.

176
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,740
I've got nothing to do with this.

177
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,250
Zenitsu, did you get smaller or something?

178
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,300
I almost got turned into a spider.

179
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:44,510
My arms and legs
are really short right now.

180
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:46,010
Is that right?

181
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:47,680
Where's Inosuke?

182
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:49,640
Have you seen Murata?

183
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:52,560
I don't know about anyone named Murata,

184
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:55,140
but Inosuke's right next to me.

185
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,980
Hey, you're right!

186
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,820
He's been here all this time!
And I didn't notice!

187
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:07,740
Inosuke, I'm so glad you're all right!

188
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,830
I'm so glad you're all right!

189
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:15,410
I'm so sorry! I couldn't rescue you!

190
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,210
It's okay.

191
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:21,670
Don't worry about it.

192
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,710
Paper! Paper!
Do something about this!

193
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,170
Your voice...

194
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:27,090
Is that you, Inosuke?

195
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:28,260
Wipe it! Hey! Do you hear me? Hey!

196
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:31,100
I heard he lost his voice or something.

197
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:35,100
I don't have all the details,

198
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:38,310
but I heard he, like, got hit in the neck,

199
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:42,440
and when he yelled at the top of his lungs
at the end, that finished it off.

200
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,110
And it did a number on his throat.

201
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:49,450
He's depressed now, so it's made him
gentle, and it really cracks me up!

202
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:55,370
Why are you cackling
in that creepy way all of a sudden?

203
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:57,370
What's going on?

204
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:03,840
I'm sorry for being so weak.

205
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:10,510
Hang in there, Inosuke!

206
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,760
It's not like you to get depressed!

207
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:15,970
Come on, you did good!
You're awesome!

208
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:18,930
I'm just so happy that you're alive!

209
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:21,520
Did I take my morning meds?

210
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,770
Did you see me take them?
Somebody? Did you see?

211
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:26,650
Somebody? Did you see?

212
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:40,580
Zenitsu...

213
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:42,120
Inosuke...

214
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,750
Thank goodness.

215
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:46,670
You're alive.

216
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,740
It's all right now.

217
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:13,490
They said you could use
this room, Nezuko.

218
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:19,040
Ouch, ouch, ouch!

219
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:25,250
I really got roughed up
on Mt. Natagumo.

220
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:27,920
It hurts a lot.

221
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:31,300
To be honest, it hurts like crazy.

222
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:33,590
Nezuko...

223
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:38,060
Thanks for protecting me
on the mountain.

224
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:42,020
Who would've guessed that not only you,

225
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:45,190
but Mr. Urokodaki
and Mr. Tomioka, as well...

226
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:50,320
They're all risking their lives for us.

227
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,570
They're all taking care of us.

228
00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:56,120
I need to...

229
00:16:57,070 --> 00:16:59,200
become stronger.

230
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,370
Even today...

231
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:09,250
The Master more or less
saved both your life and mine.

232
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:13,130
That man's voice...

233
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:16,180
It was so soothing in a mysterious way.

234
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:21,810
Just listening to him speak
made my head feel light.

235
00:17:22,930 --> 00:17:24,640
I wonder what kind of person he is.

236
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:38,660
Oh, right.

237
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,950
You're sleep-deprived, aren't you?

238
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,540
I'm hurting, and this is tough,

239
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,000
but I gotta keep on fighting.

240
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:50,340
Because...

241
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:53,340
I'll be a grown man one day.

242
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:54,670
And then,

243
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:57,640
I'll become an old guy and die.

244
00:17:58,930 --> 00:18:00,220
And then,

245
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:03,350
the demon Nezuko will end up all alone.

246
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:09,150
That would be too lonely,
wouldn't it, Nezuko?

247
00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:16,360
I promise you I'll turn you
back into a human, okay?

248
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:25,700
Just as you've all reported,

249
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:29,330
the demons' carnage
has increased more than ever.

250
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:34,340
Meaning that the threat to human life
is greater than it's ever been.

251
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:37,800
We'll have to bolster the ranks
of the Demon Slayers.

252
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:39,800
What do you all think?

253
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:44,100
The incident on Mt. Natagumo
made it crystal clear.

254
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:48,020
The caliber of Demon Slayers
has nose-dived to unbelievable levels.

255
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:49,940
Most of them are useless.

256
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:53,860
The trainers must be blind.

257
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:58,610
You'd think they could at least tell
if someone's competent or not.

258
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:02,030
Well, that kid today
sure seemed competent.

259
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:06,790
He did land that flamboyant blow on you,
Shinazugawa. He's got potential.

260
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:11,080
The more the human population increases,

261
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:14,300
the harder it becomes
to control and unify them.

262
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:19,050
Not to mention that the times
have changed considerably in this era.

263
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:23,760
Other than those who've had their loved ones
brutally massacred, and joined the Corps,

264
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:27,730
or those of distinguished pedigree
who have hunted demons for generations,

265
00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:30,350
to ask anyone to harness as much

266
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:36,030
or even greater resolve and drive
to produce results would be cruel.

267
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:41,950
Still, considering that boy ran into a Twelve Kizuki
so soon after joining the Corps...

268
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:44,030
He may have the power to draw them!

269
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:48,950
Even we rarely get the chance
to confront one! It makes me envious!

270
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,460
Agreed.

271
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:57,590
But the fact that Lower Five
made such a drastic move

272
00:19:57,590 --> 00:20:01,180
probably means that Muzan
is nowhere near Mt. Natagumo.

273
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:04,090
After all, as in the case of Asakusa,

274
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:06,760
whenever Muzan wishes
to hide something,

275
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:11,230
he creates a clever diversion
to throw us off.

276
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:14,650
It's really quite frustrating.

277
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:24,490
But those demons are still freely devouring
humans, gaining strength and surviving.

278
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:30,250
For the sake of those who have died,
there is only one thing for us to do.

279
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:35,630
I believe that among you Hashiras
who are present today,

280
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:41,420
I've assembled the finest unit since
the First Breathing swordsmen of the feudal era.

281
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:43,930
Tengen Uzui.

282
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:46,430
Kyojuro Rengoku.

283
00:20:46,930 --> 00:20:48,560
Shinobu Kocho.

284
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:50,680
Mitsuri Kanroji.

285
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:53,190
Muichiro Tokito.

286
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:55,560
Gyomei Himejima.

287
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:57,940
Sanemi Shinazugawa.

288
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,070
Obanai Iguro.

289
00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:02,150
Giyu Tomioka.

290
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:05,660
My children,

291
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:08,870
I look forward to your success.

292
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:20,880
Muzan Kibutsuji,

293
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:24,180
I swear I'll defeat you
if it's the last thing that I do.

294
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:28,890
We will bring you down without fail.

295
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:17,290
PREVIEW

296
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:05,440
I still find it hard to believe
that some demons don't attack humans.

297
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,150
It must be a miracle or something.

298
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:11,740
If you're gonna go there, then,
us trying to find a clue about Kibutsuji is...

299
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:13,990
well, what you call a "millennial miracle"!

300
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:17,290
That's a typical and flamboyant
idea if I ever heard one!

301
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:19,920
Now, it's time for a Taisho secret!

302
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:23,710
I hear that the Master is the 97th leader
of the Demon Slayer Corps!

303
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,800
To make sure we don't squander
this opportunity,

304
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:29,220
we Hashiras need to be the glue that holds
the Demon Slayer Corps together!

305
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:31,220
Are you mentally prepared
for that, Sound Hashira?

306
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:33,300
You don't have to remind me,
Fire Hashira!

307
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:36,930
Next, Episode 24,
"Rehabilitation Training"!

308
00:23:36,930 --> 00:23:40,060
TO BE CONTINUED

308
00:23:41,305 --> 00:24:41,289
