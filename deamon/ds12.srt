1
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:03,230
Here goes...

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:04,400
Comin'...

3
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:06,400
through!

4
00:00:07,690 --> 00:00:08,770
Infuriating!

5
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:10,070
Infuriating!

6
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:16,870
Teruko!

7
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:18,410
Hold onto the furniture!

8
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:21,870
That one's a demon
with supernatural powers!

9
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:24,330
Stop launching those reckless assaults!

EPISODE 12:
THE BOAR BARES ITS FANGS,
ZENITSU SLEEPS

12
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:09,310
Infuriating!

13
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:12,480
You damn insects
running amok in my house!

14
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:28,790
The room freakin' spun around!

15
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:32,130
This is fun! This is fun!

16
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:37,720
Don't stomp all over her!

17
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:42,890
Who the hell are you?

18
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:46,890
What do you think you're doing,
stepping on a little kid like that?

19
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,230
I like it! I like it!

20
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:55,270
No human's ever sent me flying
like that before!

21
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:58,820
Why is he coming after me?

22
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:00,740
Isn't he a Demon Slayer?

23
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,820
My swords will hurt you.

24
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:07,450
Because they're not the kind of swords
you little gentlemen use!

25
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:12,120
The way they shred through flesh...
That's what I pride myself on!

26
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:14,880
Knock it off! There's a demon
right there, you know!

27
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,550
Like I care!

28
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,130
Damn insects!

29
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:22,130
Out of my sight! Die!

30
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:28,100
The floor ripped apart all of a sudden!

31
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,680
At the same speed
as the sound of the tsuzumi!

32
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:33,810
In the shape of a beast's claws!

33
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:39,190
Spinning right!

34
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:42,360
Spinning left!

35
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:43,780
Damn insects!

36
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:46,280
You damn miserable insects!

37
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:53,580
I'm starting to get the hang of it now!

38
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,880
We're in yet another room now?

39
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:03,970
But what does this mean?

40
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:07,180
That demon didn't strike
his tsuzumi just now.

41
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:11,310
I'm picking up the scent
of multiple demons in this house.

42
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:14,100
Is there another demon
with a tsuzumi, then?

43
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:16,360
Is that why...

44
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,940
I can smell blood.

45
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:23,950
It's gonna be all right, okay?

46
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:26,320
Just stay behind me.

47
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,200
Okay.

48
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,960
Another human ripped to shreds
and devoured!

49
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,840
Wh-What's the matter?

50
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:45,050
It's all right.
There are no demons around.

51
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,220
Come on, let's head over there.

52
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,140
Without a backward glance.

53
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:52,180
Look straight ahead, okay?

54
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:58,230
Now there's another scent.

55
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:02,110
A unique scent of blood
I've never smelled before.

56
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:05,240
Looks like there wasn't that much bleeding.

57
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:38,230
Excuse me, Zenitsu.

58
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:50,120
Signal... Signal... Signal... Signal me first!

59
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,740
If you want to talk,
don't come at me all of a sudden!

60
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:56,540
My heart nearly flew
out of my mouth just now!

61
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,920
I'm sorry.

62
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:00,880
If that had come to pass,

63
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:04,550
that would've made you a murderer
for sure! Do you get that?

64
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:06,800
It's just that... See...

65
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:10,220
You've been sweating, gasping
and shivering so horribly.

66
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:14,010
What about it?
Aren't I doing the best I can here?

67
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,100
Well, forgive me for saying so,

68
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:19,560
but you're making me nervous, too, so...

69
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,560
Oh no! Sorry about that!

70
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,940
Even still... Even still...

71
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:27,650
If we talk too much,
those demons and all will...

72
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,280
They might find us, right?

73
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:30,320
That's why...

74
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:34,700
I think it would be best
to be as quiet as possible! Right?

75
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:44,460
A couple of kids.

76
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:47,090
Probably most agreeable to the tongue.

77
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:49,510
What did I tell you?

78
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:52,970
A demon showed up!
A demon showed up, understand?

79
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:56,970
DEMON SLAYER:
KIMETSU NO YAIBA

80
00:06:56,970 --> 00:07:00,980
DEMON SLAYER:
KIMETSU NO YAIBA

81
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,820
Stay away! Stay away from us!

82
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:08,400
Stop that!

83
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:14,580
W-W-We don't taste good!
I'm sure I taste awful!

84
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:17,450
I'm serious, okay?
This kid's all skin and bones,

85
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:20,330
so he's all dry and tastes ghastly!

86
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:25,170
How will I know until I have a taste?

87
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:26,920
Nooooo!

88
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:30,090
What was that? Quick-tongued!

89
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:31,800
Splitting a vase in two!

90
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:35,970
That's just not possible!

91
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:42,190
Zenitsu! Get up!

92
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:46,650
It's in my knees now!
80 percent of my fear is in my knees!

93
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:49,280
This is no time to whine, all right?

94
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:52,400
Just leave me behind, okay?

95
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:54,280
Make a run for it!

96
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,950
I can't do something like that!

97
00:07:57,790 --> 00:07:59,700
What a great kid this is!

98
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:02,500
Even though I'm making
terrified sounds like this!

99
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:05,290
I gotta find a way somehow!

100
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,750
If I don't protect him,
what will become of him?

101
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,800
Dying before he reaches double digits
would be way too tragic!

102
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:14,130
But I'm so horribly weak!

103
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:15,050
Get up!

104
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:17,720
I don't have the ability to protect him!

105
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:20,560
But if I don't protect him...

106
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:28,320
I'm gonna guzzle your brain matter
through your ears!

107
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:34,570
Zenitsu!

108
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:35,740
Zenit—

109
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,580
He's fast asleep.

110
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:47,080
What's up with him?

111
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:00,810
Die!

112
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:03,730
Zenitsu!

113
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:06,400
Please wake up!

114
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:40,470
Wh-What's this sound?

115
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,930
This guy...

116
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:44,270
He's giving off a different vibe!

117
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:46,810
Zenitsu...

118
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:53,110
Thunder Breathing First Form,

119
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:55,150
Thunderclap and Flash.

120
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,300
It's dead!

121
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:19,300
All of a sudden, it's dead!

122
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:21,970
What the hell? I can't take this!

123
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:24,850
What is this? What is this? Yuck!

124
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:29,770
Shoichi...

125
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:31,730
Don't tell me...

126
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:35,320
Thank you! You saved my life!

127
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:37,950
I shall be eternally grateful
to you for this!

128
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:42,320
Why didn't you tell me sooner
that you were so powerful?

129
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:46,450
What are you talking about?

130
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:49,040
Did you say something?

131
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:51,330
No.

132
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:55,670
Uh, no. Forget it.

133
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:57,800
Let's go now, okay?

134
00:10:58,050 --> 00:10:58,800
Okay.

135
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:02,760
Damn! He sent me flying again!

136
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:06,770
It's been like this
for the last three days, dammit!

137
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:10,520
Making my way
through a cramped building like this...

138
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,860
It's just not my thing
for crying out loud!

139
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,820
Hey, you dodged me.

140
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:26,120
You seem to be a pretty fresh human.

141
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:31,250
Your flesh will be well worth
gouging out!

142
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:39,010
Self-taught... Beast Breathing.

143
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:43,340
It's gonna be so worth it
to shred such a huge target!

144
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,430
You've got guts to charge me
head-on like that!

145
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:55,770
Flaunt your corpse

146
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:57,820
and serve as my springboard!

147
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:01,490
Fang Three Devour!

148
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:12,290
Comin' through! Comin' through!

149
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,090
Marechi...

150
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:19,670
Marechi...

151
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:21,800
If I can just devour some...

152
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,340
Fifty...

153
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,800
No, a hundred humans' worth...

154
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:32,140
I gotta search for more humans
with marechi and consume them.

155
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:33,810
That way...

156
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:38,820
LOWER MOON SIX

157
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:38,270
I can reclaim my place
among the Twelve Kizuki!

158
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:50,120
Kyogai.

159
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:54,620
You can't eat any more?

160
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,790
Is that all you've got?

161
00:12:57,330 --> 00:12:58,540
No.

162
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:00,050
No, I'm not done!

163
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,800
P-Please give me more time!

164
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:08,600
J-Just a little!

165
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:09,970
I've had enough.

166
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:12,850
I'm stripping you of your number.

167
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:16,480
That's your limit, and you've reached it.

168
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:20,900
The more humans you devour,
the stronger you can become.

169
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:23,610
And once he saw my potential,

170
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:26,860
Master Kibutsuji was willing
to share his blood with me.

171
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:31,950
The power of that man's blood
was mind-boggling.

172
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:36,460
I was sure that I'd grow
infinitely stronger than ever before,

173
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,840
be welcomed into the ranks
of the Twelve Kizuki,

174
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:42,420
continue to gorge myself on humans

175
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:46,970
and become even more powerful!
Or so I believed!

176
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:50,220
Or so I believed.

177
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,060
Brother Kiyoshi!

178
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:56,560
Brother!

179
00:13:56,810 --> 00:13:58,060
Brother!

180
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:00,150
Teruko!

181
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,070
Wh-Who's he?

182
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:06,530
I'm Tanjiro Kamado.

183
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:09,320
I've come to defeat evil demons.

184
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:12,830
Now then, show my your wounds.

185
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,080
Good for you
for hanging in there on your own.

186
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:19,330
Brother...

187
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:27,630
Now this ointment here is amazing!

188
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:30,510
My master gave it to me!

189
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:35,020
My master always wears a goblin mask.

190
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:36,140
Goblin?

191
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,310
Really?

192
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,770
Yes, it's true.

193
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:43,360
My master's ointment is so amazing,
it works in a split second.

194
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:46,240
Okay, you're all set!

195
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,660
Well? The pain's gone, isn't it?

196
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:50,870
Yes!

197
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:55,540
Do you think you can you tell me
what happened here?

198
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:01,290
A monster dragged me away,

199
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:04,960
a-and I nearly got devoured.

200
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:07,630
But just then,

201
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:10,300
another monster showed up
out of nowhere,

202
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:13,390
a-and they started fighting to the death

203
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:19,100
over who was gonna get to e-eat me.

204
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:21,980
A-And then,

205
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:25,360
the one with the tsuzumi
growing out of him...

206
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:28,490
When the other monster defeated him,

207
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:30,910
he dropped a tsuzumi!

208
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:33,910
And when I picked it up and struck it,

209
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,660
this room suddenly changed.

210
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:38,330
And I somehow held on until now!

211
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,250
A demon with tsuzumi
growing out of him...

212
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,840
So that was him?

213
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:49,760
He mentioned marechi
or something like that.

214
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,340
That's right!

215
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,890
He kept calling me "Marechi"!

216
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:58,310
What is "marechi"?

217
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,640
It refers to the owner of rare blood!

218
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:06,400
You little brats!

219
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:08,190
I'm going to peck you now.

220
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,820
Cut it out!

221
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:13,280
What do you mean by "rare blood"?

222
00:16:13,530 --> 00:16:17,580
The blood of all living species
can be categorized into types, idiot!

223
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:19,370
And the ultimate marechi...

224
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:21,500
The more scarce the blood,

225
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:24,250
the more uncommon...

226
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,330
For a demon!

227
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:28,500
A single marechi human has the same
nutritional value as eating fifty!

228
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,710
One hundred humans!

229
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:33,260
For demons, marechi is a feast!

230
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:39,010
Marechi is their favorite food!

231
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:49,780
Marechi...

232
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,030
Marechi...

233
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:55,740
I'm leaving this room now.

234
00:16:57,070 --> 00:16:57,950
Keep calm.

235
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,290
It's all right.

236
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:01,660
I'm just going to take down that demon.

237
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,620
Listen to me, Teruko.

238
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:08,340
Right now, your brother
is terribly exhausted.

239
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:10,250
So, you gotta look after him, okay?

240
00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:15,720
As soon as I leave the room,
strike that tsuzumi and move out.

241
00:17:16,090 --> 00:17:18,140
Just like Kiyoshi's been doing until now,

242
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:21,520
whenever someone tries to open
the door or you hear something,

243
00:17:21,850 --> 00:17:24,520
strike that tsuzumi right away
and make a run for it.

244
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:27,310
I promise to come get you.

245
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:29,570
I'll follow your scent.

246
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:33,030
I'll call out your names
when I open the door.

247
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,370
You just have to hold out a little longer.

248
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:40,120
You can do it, right?

249
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,080
Good for you!

250
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:45,620
You're so strong!

251
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:49,500
I'm heading out.

252
00:17:58,180 --> 00:17:59,010
Strike it!

253
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,350
Damn insects!

254
00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:05,350
So infuriating!

255
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:24,700
The tsuzumi on his right shoulder
flips the room right!

256
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:28,170
The left one flips it left!

257
00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:30,880
Right leg, forward spin!

258
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,800
Left leg, backward spin!

259
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:37,970
The tsuzumi on his belly
launches that claw attack!

260
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,110
So fast!

261
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:58,570
The speed of the rotations
and attacks is devastating!

262
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,820
Miss Tamayo did treat my wounds,

263
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:04,030
but these injuries aren't fully healed yet!

264
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:06,790
Can I beat him?

265
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:07,910
Can I?

266
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:12,920
These injuries hurt so bad
I can hardly stand it!

267
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:17,920
All this time, I've just been enduring it!

268
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:21,390
When I pulled Zenitsu off that girl,

269
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:25,890
when I shouted out,
I was enduring the most terrible pain!

270
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:29,020
I was able to withstand it
because I'm the eldest son!

271
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,770
But I couldn't have
if I were the second son!

272
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,400
Whenever I dig in,

273
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:38,860
the broken parts creak,
and I can't muster any strength.

274
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:45,530
That demon's attack is leaving scars
that look like claw marks.

275
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:48,830
It scares me so much
that I can't move in closer!

276
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:52,000
Since I'm not at full strength,

277
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:55,040
if I charge forward
to get within striking distance,

278
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:57,840
a flash of pain makes me stumble!

279
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:02,130
I'll get sliced into rings!

280
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:07,850
My injuries are making me
imagine the most awful things!

281
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:10,390
Mr. Urokodaki!

282
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:14,940
Water can change into any form.

283
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:18,440
Pour it into a container,
and it's a square.

284
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:20,690
Pour it into a bottle, and it's round.

285
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:25,280
Sometimes, it can even smash boulders
and flow away as far as the eye can see.

286
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:26,830
That's right!

287
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,160
That's right!

288
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:31,540
There are ten Water Breathing forms!

289
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,040
So, I can battle any kind of opponent!

290
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:36,250
If you're hurt,

291
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,710
then make a move
that will compensate for it!

292
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,760
I can take on any form!

293
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,800
And this flow will never be stopped!

294
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:50,060
Right now, it's not just my bones!
My heart's also been broken!

295
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:54,810
A broken Tanjiro's not gonna do any good!

296
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:57,400
All right! If you could
please quiet down!

297
00:20:58,150 --> 00:21:00,030
Look straight ahead!

298
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:02,490
Rouse yourself!

299
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,530
Give it all you've got, Tanjiro!

300
00:21:06,410 --> 00:21:07,740
Give it all you've got!

301
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:13,830
I've done a good job until now!

302
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,040
I have what it takes!

303
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:18,340
And not today...

304
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,170
or any time in the future!

305
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,130
Even if I'm broken...

306
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:28,640
I'll never give up no matter what!

307
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:37,140
RUSTLE RUSTLE

308
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:37,140
PREVIEW

309
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:05,530
Give it all you've got, Tanjiro!
Give it all you've got!

310
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:08,820
I'm the eldest son, so I can endure it!

311
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:11,320
You're gonna cheer me on,
too, right, Nezuko?

312
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:12,320
Thanks, Nezuko!

313
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,700
Okay, to show my gratitude,
I'm gonna cheer you on, too!

314
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:18,080
Give it all you've got, Nezuko!
Give it all you've got!

315
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:21,580
You'll never give up no matter what!

316
00:23:22,290 --> 00:23:25,500
You're the eldest daughter,
but if anything bad happens to you,

317
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:27,210
don't endure it. Just tell me, okay?

318
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:31,640
Next, Episode 13,
"Something More Important Than Life."

319
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:35,890
Looks like we've run out of time
for the Taisho secret!

320
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:40,020
TO BE CONTINUED
