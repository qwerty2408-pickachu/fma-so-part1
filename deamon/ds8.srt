1
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:09,190
Dear, what's the matter?

2
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:12,360
Dear?

3
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:16,870
Stop!

EPISODE 8:
THE SMELL OF ENCHANTING BLOOD

6
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:01,550
What's this?

7
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:02,470
What's going on?

8
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:03,850
I-Is that blood?

9
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:07,810
Stop it!

10
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:16,820
Dear!

11
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:18,450
Ma'am!

12
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:20,410
You need to worry about yourself!

13
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:24,160
Please take a cloth
and press down hard on the wound!

14
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,670
It's all right.
Somehow, it's going to turn out fine.

15
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,040
The wife's wound isn't fatal!

16
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:34,670
Do it harder!

17
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,420
Do it harder! Tie it up with a rope!

18
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:39,220
It's going to be all right.

19
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,430
This man hasn't killed anyone!

20
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:47,680
Just a second ago, this man
was just walking down this street!

21
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,560
Are you all right?

22
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:52,690
You mustn't look.

23
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:55,650
It's dangerous here, Rei.
Let's move over there.

24
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:56,940
Where'd he go?

25
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:10,960
Dammit!

26
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:13,210
Dammit!

27
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:18,920
I can't leave this man here!

28
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,510
Muzan Kibutsuji!

29
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:23,840
I'm not letting you get away!

30
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:26,430
No matter where you go!

31
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:29,520
What's the matter with that child?

32
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:31,440
What do you think, Tsukihiko?

33
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,400
No matter where you go,
you're not getting away!

34
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:39,400
I'll follow you to the ends of Hell,

35
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:42,110
and I swear I'll slice off
your head with my blade!

36
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,620
I'll never forgive you no matter what!

37
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:47,370
What the hell are you doing?

38
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:48,790
Is it a drunk?

39
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,210
Kid, step away from that man!

40
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:52,250
I can't!

41
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,040
Bring some restraints please!

42
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:55,040
Please!

43
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:56,710
Shut up and step away!

44
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:58,130
Please don't do that!

45
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:00,460
No one can hold
this person down but me!

46
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:01,260
Move!

47
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:02,720
Please don't do that!

48
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:06,800
Just look at this guy's face!
Has he lost his mind?

49
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:08,560
Pull the kid off him!

50
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,020
Please stop!

51
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:13,060
I don't want this person to kill anyone!

52
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:16,560
Just stay out of my way, will you?
I'm begging you!

53
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,520
Dammit! Look, you...

54
00:04:18,770 --> 00:04:21,070
If you're going to keep resisting...

55
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:29,330
Enchanting Blood.

56
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:31,410
Aroma of Visual Fantasy.

57
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,080
What's this scent?

58
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:37,960
What are all these patterns?

59
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,840
What's going on? I can't see anything!

60
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:46,140
Is this some kind of attack?

61
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:47,800
If it is, that means trouble!

62
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,220
Is the scent growing stronger?

63
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:01,230
You still use...

64
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:03,740
the term "person"...

65
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:07,700
to refer to even a transformed demon.

66
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:10,490
And you're trying to save him.

67
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,750
Allow me, then, to lend you a hand.

68
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:17,750
But why?

69
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:18,830
You...

70
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:20,460
Your scent tells me...

71
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:22,460
That's right.

72
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,960
I am...

73
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,800
...a demon, but I am also a doctor,

74
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:34,520
and I wish to annihilate
that man, Kibutsuji.

75
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,520
Aren't you coming, Daddy?

76
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,610
Daddy has work.

77
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:45,070
I have a business meeting to attend.

78
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:48,030
I'm also concerned
about that disturbance just now.

79
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:49,570
Dear...

80
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:50,870
Don't worry.

81
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,660
I'm only going to speak with the police.

82
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:55,540
Now, get in.

83
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:01,630
Daddy, come home soon, okay?

84
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:04,380
All right. You be a good girl now.

85
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:06,260
Take them back to the house.

86
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,680
Go on.

87
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:23,480
Big Bro, let's hit one more bar!

88
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:25,990
Yacchan, are you okay?

89
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:27,740
I'm fine! I'm fine!

90
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:30,490
I'm not even drunk yet—

91
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:32,410
What the hell, you bastard?

92
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:37,330
Forgive me.

93
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,920
Hey, come back here!

94
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:46,760
I'm very sorry,
but I happen to be in a hurry, so...

95
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:49,130
What did you say?

96
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:53,300
Hey, look at you, decked out
in those posh-looking threads!

97
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:55,010
You piss me off!

98
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:57,980
You and your pale face...

99
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:00,520
You look like you're about to fall over dead!

100
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:07,610
Hey, say something, will you?
Or did you just croak?

101
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,530
Yacchan!

102
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:16,370
What did you do to my kid brother?

103
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:17,910
Yacchan!

104
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,120
He's dead!

105
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:21,500
Yacchan's not breathing!

106
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:24,290
You bastard!

107
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:47,690
Does my complexion
look unhealthy to you?

108
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,070
Is my face pale?

109
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:55,830
Do I look sickly to you?

110
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,000
Do I look like I'm not long
for this world?

111
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:02,790
Do I look like I'm about to die?

112
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:08,000
Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong.

113
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:13,380
I'm a living being
who's infinitely close to perfection.

114
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:29,230
What do you think will happen
if I keep flooding you with my blood?

115
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:41,410
The human body is unable to withstand
the speed of transformation.

116
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,500
And its cells are destroyed.

117
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:14,150
Bring me the head of the Demon Slayer
who wears hanafuda-like earrings.

118
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:16,910
Understood?

119
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,030
As you wish.

120
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,990
Your wish is our command.

121
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:33,090
Those earrings...

122
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:42,100
DEMON SLAYER:
KIMETSU NO YAIBA

123
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:46,100
DEMON SLAYER:
KIMETSU NO YAIBA

124
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:49,020
Now, listen to me! Here's the deal...

125
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,270
My point is this, okay?

126
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,320
It's not about the money!

127
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:58,530
What I can't forgive is your lack of intent
to eat my udon, all right?

128
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:01,410
I'm so sorry!
Please serve me another bowl!

129
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:02,620
So, you're gonna eat it?

130
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:03,410
Yes!

131
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:05,040
You're definitely gonna eat it?

132
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,120
Yes, I shall!

133
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:07,410
Okay!

134
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:08,710
You, too!

135
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:11,710
If you're gonna have udon,
take off that bamboo thingie first!

136
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:13,170
What is that thing anyway?

137
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:15,300
Take these chopsticks! Chopsticks!

138
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:18,930
I'd like a bowl of udon!

139
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:20,850
I'd like two bowls of udon!

140
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:22,470
R-Right.

141
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:38,490
Thank you very much for the meal!

142
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:40,360
That was delicious!

143
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:43,580
As long as you get it! It's all good!

144
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:44,870
Thanks for your business!

145
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:46,580
UDON

146
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:48,160
Sorry about that, Nezuko.

147
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:50,210
Leaving you behind like that...

148
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:54,040
What's wrong, Nezuko?

149
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,680
So, you've been waiting for us?

150
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:08,180
Because I was told
to bring you to see her.

151
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,520
I could've tracked you by scent.

152
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:13,810
She's in a place
that's under a cloaking spell.

153
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:15,610
No way could you find it.

154
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:17,570
Cloaking?

155
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:19,610
Anyway...

156
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,490
Isn't that woman a demon?

157
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:25,490
And an eyesore to boot.

158
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:28,910
Eyesore?

159
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:30,460
Eyesore?

160
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:32,880
Does he mean "ugly"?

161
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:34,500
Who?

162
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,090
Nezuko?

163
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,510
Who in their right mind
would call her an eyesore?

164
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,890
Just take a good look at her features!

165
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:47,720
She was the beauty
of our hometown! Our Nezuko!

166
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,440
Let's go.

167
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,060
Sure, we'll go, but still...

168
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:55,060
No way is she an eyesore!
Not on your life!

169
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:58,480
Take a look at her
where there's a bit more light!

170
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:01,490
Come on, let's go over there!

171
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:10,080
Oh, I know what it is!
It's this muzzle, right?

172
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,160
It might be because of this muzzle!

173
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:16,380
I'd like you to behold Nezuko
without the muzzle!

174
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:20,170
Hurry it up.

175
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:21,880
While no one's around.

176
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:35,560
There's a house
behind the dead end!

177
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:37,190
Get over here!

178
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:41,070
Listen. Make sure you don't offend
that person in any way.

179
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,990
Personally, I couldn't care less
what happens to you.

180
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:47,070
But I brought you here
because she insisted!

181
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:48,700
R-Right.

182
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:52,200
Come in.

183
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:54,830
I have returned.

184
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:56,920
Welcome back.

185
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:01,550
I'm sorry that I left you
to take care of things just now.

186
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:02,970
How is the lady?

187
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:05,590
She'll be just fine.

188
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:10,850
Unfortunately, I have to keep
her husband restrained in the basement.

189
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:19,110
Isn't treating human wounds
unbearable for you?

190
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:28,570
You think demons treat humans while choking
back their own drool at the smell of blood?

191
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,040
Sorry.

192
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:35,620
Stop it. Why would you
resort to violence?

193
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:40,340
I never introduced myself, did I?

194
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:42,840
My name is Tamayo.

195
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:44,720
That boy is Yushiro.

196
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:46,970
I hope that you'll be his friend.

197
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:54,020
I don't think that's gonna happen.

198
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:56,060
It's not unbearable, you know.

199
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,810
I believe it's much easier for me
than for normal demons.

200
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:05,820
Because I've tweaked
my body considerably.

201
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,030
I've also removed Kibutsuji's curse.

202
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:13,950
Curse? T-Tweaked your body?

203
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,000
Come this way.

204
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:29,510
Hey, Nezuko, that's bad manners!

205
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:32,430
That's quite all right.

206
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,390
Please make yourselves at home.

207
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:36,480
Sorry.

208
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:39,900
Now then, allow me to continue.

209
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:44,320
I adjusted our bodies so that we can live
without devouring humans.

210
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:48,070
A small amount of human blood
is all we need.

211
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:49,610
Blood?

212
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,320
You mean...

213
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:54,410
You may find it distasteful,

214
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:56,830
but what I do is buy blood

215
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,870
under the guise of transfusions
from those unable to make ends meet.

216
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:03,880
Of course, no more
than would impair them.

217
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:05,880
I see.

218
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:10,720
So, that's why I'm not picking up that strange
scent unique to demons from these two.

219
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:13,890
But they do need human blood after all.

220
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,310
If blood is all they need, then Nezuko...

221
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:21,310
Yushiro can get by with even less blood.

222
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:24,060
I'm the one who turned him
into a demon.

223
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:26,440
You did that?

224
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:27,780
But...

225
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:30,860
You're right.

226
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:35,700
It's generally held that no one
but Kibutsuji can reproduce demons.

227
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,120
That's more or less accurate.

228
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:41,120
After more than 200 years,

229
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:45,040
I was only able to transform Yushiro
into a demon after all.

230
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:48,340
Two...

231
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:52,090
Two hundred years...

232
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:57,260
You were only able to transform Yushiro
after more than 200 years?

233
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,230
Exactly how old are you, Miss Tamayo?

234
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:04,360
Don't ask a lady her age,
you ill-mannered scoundrel!

235
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,480
Yushiro!

236
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:08,320
The next time you hit that boy,
I'll make you regret it!

237
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,360
Yes, ma'am!

238
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,860
She's beautiful even when she's angry!

239
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:18,790
There's one thing
I'd like to clear up with you.

240
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:22,540
I'm not trying to create more demons.

241
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,460
I only perform the procedure
on the terminally ill

242
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:29,710
or those so gravely injured
that they don't have long to live.

243
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:32,680
And in those cases,

244
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:37,220
I always ask them beforehand
if they wish to live on even as demons.

245
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:45,810
The scent she's giving off is pure
and devoid of deception.

246
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,230
She's someone I can trust.

247
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:50,900
Miss Tamayo,

248
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:56,570
is there a way to return a transformed
demon back to human form?

249
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,130
See anything?

250
00:17:16,590 --> 00:17:17,640
I can see.

251
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:20,640
I can see footprints.

252
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:22,980
This is it. This is it.

253
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:29,190
Making a huge turn over there.

254
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:35,030
There are three of them.

255
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,070
And one's carrying some kind of big box.

256
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:43,540
How should we kill them, I wonder.

257
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:47,420
I can feel the flow of power.

258
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:51,420
Because of all the blood
he shared with me.

259
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:56,380
Of course we're going to
slay them vindictively.

260
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:00,260
There is a way to turn a demon...

261
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:02,100
back into a human.

262
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:03,890
Please tell me how!

263
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:08,270
Don't you dare get so close to Lady Tamayo!

264
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,650
Yushiro...

265
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:15,110
Yes, ma'am! I only threw him.
Lady Tamayo. I did not hit him.

266
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,780
You mustn't do either.

267
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:17,530
Yes, ma'am!

268
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:20,030
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

269
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,370
Please tell me how.

270
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:28,870
For any kind of wound, there's always
some kind of medicine or treatment.

271
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:32,920
At this time, I'm unable to turn
a demon back into a human,

272
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:35,880
but surely, that, too...

273
00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:38,880
However,

274
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:44,470
we are dedicated to establishing
such a method of treatment.

275
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:49,350
Towards that end, I'd like to ask you
to do something for me.

276
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,230
To produce such an elixir,

277
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,570
it is necessary to study
the blood of numerous demons.

278
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:59,030
I have two favors to ask of you.

279
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:03,990
One, permission to study
your sister's blood.

280
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:08,960
Two, to retrieve
blood samples from demons

281
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:11,790
as closely related to Kibutsuji
as possible.

282
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:17,170
Nezuko's current condition
is extremely rare and unique.

283
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,430
I understand that she was asleep
for two straight years,

284
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:24,050
and I believe that her body underwent
changes during that time.

285
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:27,600
Normally, any demon who went that long

286
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:31,270
without consuming the flesh
or blood of a human or beast

287
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:34,400
would unquestionably go berserk.

288
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:37,400
Lady Tamayo is beautiful today, too!

289
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:39,820
I'm sure she'll be
beautiful again tomorrow!

290
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:46,120
And yet, surprisingly,
Nezuko shows none of those signs.

291
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:50,000
This miracle will be the key
to finding a solution.

292
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:51,960
Nezuko...

293
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:02,050
The other request I have for you
is a harsh one.

294
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:05,510
By "demons closely related to Kibutsuji,"

295
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:11,770
I meant demons whose powers are more
on par with that of Kibutsuji himself.

296
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:15,730
It won't be easy to extract blood
from such demons.

297
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:21,530
Are you still willing
to go along with my requests?

298
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:30,540
If there's no other way, then I'll do it.

299
00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:33,790
If it means you're going to research
all these demons' blood

300
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,960
and create this medicine...

301
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:39,670
If that happens, that means
it won't just be Nezuko.

302
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:43,380
Lots of other people
will be saved, too, right?

303
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:48,470
That's right.

304
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:55,350
Get down!

305
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:10,540
Did you decide how to kill them?

306
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:12,910
Vindictively, of course!

307
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:03,230

RUSTLE RUSTLE

309
00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:06,070
I'm starting with the Taisho secret today!

310
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:12,320
LADY TAMAYO

311
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:08,990
Yushiro's hobby is to write
in his Lady Tamayo journal.

312
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:12,320
I hear that he churns out
seven to ten pages a day.

313
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:15,910
And now, I've found that very journal.
Let's take a peek, huh?

314
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:17,580
Let's see.

315
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:21,040
"January 10. Lady Tamayo was ethereal
and gorgeous again today.

316
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:24,380
At 17:10, she called my name.
Twice, no less!

317
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:26,130
Her voice was beautiful.

318
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:31,090
At 17:29, when Lady Tamayo,
deep in thought, slipped on the step..."
