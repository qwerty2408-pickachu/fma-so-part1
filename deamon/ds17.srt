1
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:05,310
The blood of the Twelve Kizuki

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,730
should have a high degree
of Kibutsuji's blood.

3
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:09,820
If I can extract it,

4
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:13,240
the medicine that will turn Nezuko
back into a human can be completed sooner!

5
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:17,030
Hold on! Inosuke!

6
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:23,330
So, did you defeat it?

7
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:26,040
Are you all right, Inosuke?

8
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:28,710
I asked you whether you defeated
that thing or not!

9
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:29,800
Uh, yeah, I did!

10
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:32,170
But anyway, Inosuke,
how are you feeling?

11
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:35,550
Don't go showering me
with your sensitivity and kindness!

12
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:37,890
You hear me? Got that?

13
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:41,560
After all, anything you can do,
I can do, too!

14
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:43,560
Before you know it,

15
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:46,560
my head will be harder than yours!

16
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:49,690
Not to mention... Not to mention...

17
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:50,820
Um...

18
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:53,570
He's wounded severely.

19
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:56,820
I couldn't save our other friends, either.

20
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:01,290
That person gave off
the scent of terror and suffering.

21
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:06,670
Enough to make her yearn for death.

22
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:13,920
What's the deal
with this mountain anyway?

23
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,510
With one of the Twelve Kizuki present...

24
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,510
Stay still, Inosuke!

25
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,800
Cut that out! I don't need that!

26
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:18,800
...and a demon family living here...

27
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,180
I'm totally fine!

28
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:21,640
But...

29
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:24,060
I thought demons never herded together!

30
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:33,570
Ouch!

31
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:35,820
Something just pricked me!

32
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:39,160
What the hell? This is so annoying!

33
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:42,080
I can't find Tanjiro and Inosuke
anywhere! This sucks!

34
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:43,490
Where did they go?

35
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:45,910
Which way?

36
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:48,670
And it stinks around here, too! Stinks!

37
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:51,040
I think I'm gonna cry!

38
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,300
And this sound of spiders
rustling around is so creepy!

39
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:58,840
I'm sure these spiders are doing their best
to survive, too, but still!

40
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:03,430
Dammit! Shut up! Just stay still!

41
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,980
Is this even possible?

42
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:17,074

EPISODE 17:
YOU MUST MASTER A SINGLE THING

44
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:52,710
That's a spider with a human face!

45
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:55,330
What's up with that? What's up with that?

46
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:58,750
Please be a dream! Please be a dream!
Please be a dream!

47
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:01,840
If this can just be a dream,
I promise to do my best!

48
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:04,760
If I wake up to find myself
resting my head on Nezuko's lap,

49
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,760
then I promise to give it all I have!

50
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,390
I'll even plow fields!

51
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:11,270
I'll be glad to plow a whole acre,
no, even two acres!

52
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,730
So, please!

53
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:18,770
Let me wake up from this nightmare!

54
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:33,790
What the heck is that?

55
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:37,330
Are those humans
who got turned into spiders?

56
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:40,300
Is that house floating?

57
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:43,260
I can see a glimpse of something,
but are those threads?

58
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,130
And it really stinks!

59
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:47,180
Talk about pungent!

60
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,180
This would kill Tanjiro
with his keen sense of smell!

61
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,600
This smell is making my throat ache!

62
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:54,190
I'm tearing up!

63
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:55,770
My eyes hurt, too!

64
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:10,030
It's huge!

65
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:12,700
It's huge! It's huge!

66
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:14,460
It's so huge!

67
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:16,210
That thing is too huge!

68
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:26,340
You know what! I refuse to speak
with anyone like you!

69
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:33,560
It's no use running away.

70
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:35,680
You're already losing.

71
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,690
What are you muttering about?

72
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:39,610
I don't wanna hear it,
so stop talking to me!

73
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:42,020
I don't like guys like you, all right?

74
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:46,030
You already know
how dire your situation is, don't you?

75
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:47,490
What are you talking about?

76
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:49,240
Take a look at your hands.

77
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:50,530
My hands?

78
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:53,580
What's wrong with my hands—

79
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:58,080
What's this?

80
00:05:58,460 --> 00:05:59,670
It's poison.

81
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,920
You got bitten by a spider, right?

82
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:04,840
That poison will turn you into a spider, too.

83
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:09,800
In another 30 minutes,

84
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,560
you'll be my slave, crawling all over the ground!

85
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:17,310
Look at this. It's a clock.

86
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,600
Do you understand?

87
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:21,860
By the time this long hand
goes around once,

88
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:24,860
you'll have become
a member of the spider clan!

89
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:29,490
When the needle arrives here, you'll start
to feel tingling and pain in your limbs.

90
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:33,620
When it's here,
you'll also feel dizzy and nauseous!

91
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:36,620
Here, you'll experience intense pain,

92
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:38,870
your body will start to shrink,
and you'll black out!

93
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:41,920
And by the time you wake up...

94
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:56,890
DEMON SLAYER:
KIMETSU NO YAIBA

95
00:06:56,890 --> 00:07:00,900
DEMON SLAYER:
KIMETSU NO YAIBA

96
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:19,500
Running away...

97
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,170
...is futile! Right, right, right!

98
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:24,710
I know that, all right? I know that!

99
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:29,670
What do you think you're doing?

100
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:31,930
Shut up! Just shut up!

101
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:34,350
There's no need to be afraid.

102
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,270
Once the poison makes its rounds and you turn
into a spider, you'll lose all intelligence, too!

103
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:41,640
No! That's just what I don't like about this!

104
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:43,650
Why can't you understand that, huh?

105
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:46,480
I have no friends or girlfriend,
all right? No one will like me!

106
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:51,360
Huh! I can see that you want an extra dose
of poison to turn into a spider faster.

107
00:07:56,620 --> 00:08:00,620
No! No! I don't want to turn into that!

108
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,620
Get a hold of yourself!

109
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,750
Stop crying! Stop running away!

110
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,300
Doing that won't get you anywhere!

111
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:09,880
Zenitsu!

112
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,800
Come down from there!
We're going to continue training!

113
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:17,300
Oh no! I'm sure I'll die
if I do any more training!

114
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,310
I'm sure that I'll die, so...

115
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:22,810
You won't die!
Not from this level of training!

116
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:24,980
Come down from there, you little moron!

117
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:26,270
Gramps!

118
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:28,190
Call me "Master"!

119
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,690
But I love you, Gramps!

120
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:38,160
When the girl I loved made me raise money
so she could run off with another guy,

121
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:40,950
you did rescue me
from my mountain of debt!

122
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:44,620
Well, maybe all you wanted
was to train a swordsman!

123
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:47,710
I want to live up to your expectations, too!

124
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,380
But it's totally beyond me!

125
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:53,380
I do feel terrible
about the fact that I'm like this!

126
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:55,970
Just so you know, I've been training
on my own in secret, too!

127
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:57,890
I haven't been getting any sleep!

128
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:00,510
But I have absolutely nothing
to show for it!

129
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:03,980
What does this mean?
I mean, really, what does this mean?

130
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:07,900
Calm down, Zenitsu!
You do have the ability to...

131
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:09,900
I've had enough!

132
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:16,110
Zenitsu!

133
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:19,160
How tragic is my life anyway?

134
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:21,540
I got hit by lightning.

135
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:25,660
My hair color changed.

136
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:30,840
I was thankful just to be alive, but...

137
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:34,130
I...

138
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,300
I hate myself more than anyone else.

139
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:42,180
I always think
I have to get my act together,

140
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:46,600
but I end up cowering,
running away, sniveling.

141
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:51,650
I want to change.
I want to be a competent person.

142
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:54,240
Even still!

143
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:56,740
I'm doing everything I can, all right?

144
00:09:57,070 --> 00:10:00,490
So, why do I have to end up going bald
and turning into a monster?

145
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:02,990
It can't be true, right? It so can't be true!

146
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:08,000
What's up with this guy?

147
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:13,500
Oh, crap! Don't climb up here!

148
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,920
Just leave me alone for a minute!

149
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:19,180
Just for a minute, all right?

150
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:27,850
My hair's falling out already?

151
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:30,810
My hair is falling out.

152
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:33,940
Hey, he never mentioned that part to me!

153
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,040
Who is this guy?

154
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:50,210
Isn't he a demon hunter
who came here to kill our family?

155
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:52,000
Did he just faint?

156
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:54,340
I can't believe how spineless he is.

157
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:58,670
He's gonna fall onto his head and die.

158
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:00,890
What the hell?

159
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:11,230
Thunder Breathing, First Form.

160
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:20,910
Poison Sputum!

161
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:31,460
Did he just twist his body
in midair to dodge that?

162
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:35,130
Such quick reflexes!
It's like he's a totally different person!

163
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:40,130
Thunder Breathing, First Form.

164
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:42,430
Hey, you guys! Pounce on him!

165
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:49,230
Thunder Breathing, First Form.

166
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:57,650
He's been assuming
the same stance over and over.

167
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:02,450
No question about it. This guy...

168
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:06,370
is only capable of that one attack!

169
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:10,080
That's all right, Zenitsu.

170
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:12,210
That's good enough for you.

171
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,750
If you can master one,
that's cause for celebration!

172
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:21,720
If you can only do one thing,
hone it to perfection.

173
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:27,810
Hone it to the utmost limit!

174
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:31,600
Hey, but Gramps...

175
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:34,310
Just a little while ago,
you were hopping mad.

176
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:39,980
Because Thunder Breathing has three forms,
and all I can manage to do is one.

177
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:44,240
Do you know how to forge a sword?

178
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,410
I have no idea.

179
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:51,250
Will you keep hitting me? I think I'll cry.

180
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,290
The thing about swords...

181
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:56,790
You strike and strike and strike

182
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,340
to get rid of impurities
and anything you don't need,

183
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:03,880
and to increase the purity of the blade,
so a durable sword can be forged.

184
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:08,390
So that's why you keep
clobbering me day in, day out?

185
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:12,640
But I'm not made of steel, am I?

186
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:14,810
I'm living flesh, you know.

187
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:19,230
You're not much of a threat, are you?

188
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,280
You call yourself a demon hunter?

189
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:25,070
Any minute now, you'll be rendered
immobile by that poison.

190
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:28,870
Zenitsu, perfect it!

191
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:30,830
It's all right to cry.

192
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,790
It's all right to run away!

193
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:35,580
Just don't ever give up!

194
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,170
Just believe.

195
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,880
You endured all that hellish training!

196
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:44,920
You'll be rewarded for that without fail!

197
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:47,010
Hone it to the utmost limit!

198
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:50,640
Become the most durable blade of all!

199
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:54,020
Hone that one thing to perfection!

200
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,030
Get out of my sight.

201
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,580
Don't make me repeat myself.
Get out of my sight.

202
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:14,580
You know what I'm talking about.

203
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:19,460
Aren't you ashamed
of crying like a baby all day long?

204
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:23,590
You laggard...

205
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:27,260
Any time spent on you is wasted.

206
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:30,800
Sensei is an extraordinary man.

207
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:32,560
But Gramps said—

208
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:37,100
"Gramps"? Don't speak of him
in that familiar way!

209
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:39,600
Sensei is a former Hashira!

210
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:42,940
Someone who earned the highest title
in the Demon Slayer Corps!

211
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:48,070
Almost no one ever gets the chance
to be trained by a former Hashira!

212
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:52,830
The time Sensei spends training you
is all for nothing!

213
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,330
You're an eyesore, okay?
Get out of my sight!

214
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:57,620
Why are you here?

215
00:14:57,870 --> 00:15:00,330
Why do you insist on clinging here?

216
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:14,310
I have no parents,
so no one has any hopes for me.

217
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:21,690
There's no one who dreams that I'll grasp
or accomplish something one day.

218
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:25,400
That I'll prove myself useful to somebody.

219
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:27,480
That I'll manage to protect somebody

220
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:30,490
and make that person happy,
just once in my life.

221
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:32,450
Not even a simple future like that.

222
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:35,410
There's no one who hopes that I'll have one.

223
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:39,250
If you fail, cry and run away even once,

224
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:43,170
they say, "Oh, this guy's no good,"
and they walk away.

225
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:47,000
But not Gramps!

226
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:54,260
Time and time again,
he steadfastly reprimanded me.

227
00:15:56,810 --> 00:15:58,520
All those times I kept running away...

228
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:01,940
Time and time again...

229
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,020
He'd drag me right back.

230
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:11,150
Clearly, he did smack me around
a bit too much.

231
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:14,870
But he never abandoned me!

232
00:16:16,530 --> 00:16:19,290
Pierce him!
Inject him with more poison!

233
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:34,090
That should do it for him!

234
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:41,100
What's this?

235
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:43,100
The air is vibrating.

236
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:48,520
Thunder Breathing, First Form...

237
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:51,110
Thunderclap and Flash!

238
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:55,030
Sixfold!

239
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:02,370
He vanished?

240
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:24,440
Did I get slashed?

241
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:25,640
Me?

242
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:27,310
Slashed?

243
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:29,400
By him?

244
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,860
By a guy like him?

245
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:40,280
But that's absurd!

246
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:45,160
By a guy who can barely move
his arms and legs?

247
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,590
Dream...

248
00:17:57,050 --> 00:17:59,260
It's a happy dream.

249
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,140
I'm powerful.

250
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:03,020
More powerful than anyone.

251
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:07,140
I can help the weak and anyone in trouble.

252
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:09,190
Anytime.

253
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:12,690
Everything that Gramps taught me,

254
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:14,690
all the time he spent on me...

255
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:16,450
It wasn't for nothing!

256
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:20,570
A dream that, thanks to Gramps,

257
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:25,290
I became powerful
and helped out a lot of people.

258
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:30,130
But now, it's all over!

259
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:38,300
Chuntaro...

260
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:42,390
I'm so sorry.

261
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:54,820
Don't ever give up!

262
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:06,250
Don't ever give up.

263
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,920
Use the breathing technique to slow down
the poison as much as you can.

264
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:15,210
Even if it's painful, even if it's agonizing,

265
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:17,670
don't try to take the easy way out...

266
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,880
or Gramps is gonna let you have it!

267
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:22,600
Right.

268
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:26,890
And Tanjiro's gonna yell at you, too.

269
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:31,230
What was that sound?

270
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:33,190
Did lightning just strike?

271
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,690
How should I know?

272
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,990
But I'm not smelling any thunderclouds.

273
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:41,860
The acrid odor in the air
is stronger now, so I can't tell.

274
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:42,990
Inosuke!

275
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:48,000
I think I'll go that way.

276
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:51,290
Go ahead and do whatever you want!

277
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:53,290
Are you descending, Inosuke?

278
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:58,130
Are you going down the mountain?

279
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:00,340
Why would I? Just beat it!

280
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:03,140
No, no, because you're severely wounded.

281
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:05,970
I am not wounded at all!

282
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:14,860
N-N-No, Inosuke! Your injuries...
Anyone can see that...

283
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:20,570
A demon!

284
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,910
Because of the odor wafting
all over this mountain,

285
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:25,570
I couldn't pick it up at all!

286
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:31,960
I'm gonna tear you to shreds,
you damn demon!

287
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:33,500
Come back here, dammit!

288
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,630
Inosuke!

289
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:37,630
Father!

290
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,760
Who are you calling "father"?

291
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:42,590
Inosuke!

292
00:20:54,770 --> 00:20:57,270
Don't come near my family!

293
00:20:57,570 --> 00:21:00,280
Stay away!

294
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:06,160
I'm leaving the rest to you, Father.

295
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:12,870
Water Breathing, Second Form!

296
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,750
Water Wheel!

297
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:02,730
Combined Junior and Senior High School!

298
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:04,900
COMBINED JUNIOR
AND SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL!!
TALES OF A DEMON SLAYER ACADEMY

299
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:04,900
Tales of a Demon Slayer Academy!

300
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:09,490
DEMON
SLAYER
ACADEMY

301
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:06,610
A prefect's day starts
early in the morning!

302
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:08,900
ONE MORNING

303
00:23:06,610 --> 00:23:07,740
Honestly, I'd like to quit!

304
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:09,280
But there's one thing
stopping me from ever quitting!

305
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:11,620
And by that, I mean "dress code check"!

306
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:14,160
I can ogle the girls all I want
and not get yelled at!

307
00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:15,660
Nezuko!

308
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:20,960
Makomo's looking cute today, too!

309
00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:22,710
And that senpai's gorgeous, as well!

310
00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:25,130
Mr. Tomioka!

311
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:28,300
It's not what it looks like!
That was just a dress code check!

312
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:31,680
Before you start finding fault
with other people's clothing, fix your hair!

313
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:32,930
Even though it's my natural color?

314
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:35,810
Next, Episode 18, "A Forged Bond."

315
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:39,270
But it's my natural color.

316
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:39,940
TO BE CONTINUED
