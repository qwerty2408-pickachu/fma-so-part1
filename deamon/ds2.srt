1
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:07,400
Excuse me.

2
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:11,530
Would it be okay if I took
that basket, straw and some bamboo?

3
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:13,950
Sure, you're welcome to it,

4
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,740
but that basket's full of holes.

5
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:18,530
Yes. I'll pay you for it.

6
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:22,000
No, that's all right.
I mean, it's a basket with holes.

7
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:23,960
Yes, I will pay you!

8
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:27,670
No, it's all right. You can have
the bamboo and straw for free, too.

9
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,170
But I'm still paying you!

10
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:32,880
I said it's okay!
You're one stubborn kid!

11
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:36,890
Please accept this,
although it's just small change!

12
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:38,970
Thank you very much!

13
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:41,390
Ouch!

14
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:45,520
Nezuko?

15
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:48,020
Huh? Nezuko?

16
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:49,570
She's gone!

17
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:53,030
There she is.

18

EPISODE 2:
TRAINER SAKONJI UROKODAKI

20
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:35,880
Nezuko...

21
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:38,970
She dug a hole?

22
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:42,550
My kid sister's turned into a mole.

23
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:49,020
And she's frowning!

24
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,980
She must really want
to avoid the sunlight.

25
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:54,480
Wait there for a second!

26
00:02:58,650 --> 00:02:59,530
Nezuko?

27
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:01,030
Nezuko?

28
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,950
Think you can fit inside this?

29
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,950
I want to keep moving
during the day, too.

30
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:08,500
I'll carry you, okay?

31
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:11,250
Can you fit?

32
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,420
In here?

33
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:14,290
Basket.

34
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:22,470
She kinda protrudes, huh?

35
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:26,810
I can't believe she grew up.

36
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:29,850
Seems like yesterday that she was tiny.

37
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:32,810
Nezuko?

38
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:36,770
Remember how you became big
like an adult earlier?

39
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:40,320
Do you think you can do
the opposite? Get smaller?

40
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:42,360
Smaller, Nezuko!

41
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:44,450
Get smaller!

42
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:56,420
Good job!

43
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:58,130
That's a good girl, Nezuko!

44
00:03:58,380 --> 00:03:59,670
I'm impressed!

45
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,090
Mt. Sagiri?

46
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,810
If you want to go to Mt. Sagiri,
you'll have to cross over that mountain, but...

47
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:14,400
The sun's about to set. Are you really
heading there with all that luggage?

48
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:15,940
It's dangerous, you know.

49
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:18,650
I'll be careful.

50
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,900
Thank you very much.

51
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:27,370
People have gone missing lately!

52
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,200
Try not to lose your way!

53
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:40,050
There's a temple over there.

54
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:44,430
There's light leaking through,
so someone must be there.

55
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,050
Let's check it out.

56
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:51,970
I smell blood!

57
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:55,810
This mountain path is pretty rough!
Someone must've gotten hurt!

58
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:04,360
Are you all right?

59
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:14,120
What the hell?

60
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:17,370
This is my turf.

61
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,500
If you break into my territory,

62
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,340
I'll make you pay!

63
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,340
It's a man-eating demon!

64
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:40,230
There's something off about you.

65
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:44,780
Are you both humans?

66
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:02,670
A hatchet, huh? Not bad.

67
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:05,130
But a scratch like this...

68
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:07,380
should heal in no time.

69
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:13,220
See that? The bleeding's stopped already.

70
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:34,160
He's so fast!
And he's unbelievably strong!

71
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:36,910
You won't get me twice!

72
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,330
All right.

73
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:40,500
I'm gonna snap your neck!

74
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:06,280
Sh-She killed him!

75
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:08,900
Oh, but wait! He's a demon, so...

76
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,570
N-Nezuko...

77
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:17,870
I don't believe this!

78
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:21,460
Did he just move without his head?!

79
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:22,790
You bastards!

80
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:29,090
One of you is a demon after all?
You gave off such a weird vibe!

81
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:32,260
What's a human and a demon
doing teaming up?

82
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:34,180
He's actually talking!

83
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:43,560
Stop it!

84
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,820
Nezuko!

85
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:02,920
Nezuko!

86
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:10,630
What's the deal with this guy?

87
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:12,970
Growing arms from his head!

88
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:15,340
I gotta save Nezuko!

89
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:18,600
Out of my way!

90
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,310
Hard as a rock!

91
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:27,360
That head of his...

92
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:29,570
Like a rock!

93
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,160
Okay!

94
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:46,210
I wrapped my hair around his hatchet
to grab it, but it got tangled up! Dammit!

95
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:51,670
Nezuko! Where are you?

96
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:04,980
Nezuko!

97
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,020
Stop it!

98
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:16,030
DEMON SLAYER:
KIMETSU NO YAIBA

99
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:20,030
DEMON SLAYER:
KIMETSU NO YAIBA

100
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:45,770
I wonder if there are tons
of demons out there.

101
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:49,020
This isn't the scent
that was lingering in my house.

102
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:50,560
That was a different demon...

103
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,110
But...

104
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:54,820
I gotta finish him off...

105
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:56,650
or he'll attack more people!

106
00:09:57,490 --> 00:09:58,530
So...

107
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:01,370
I gotta do it!

108
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:08,290
Do it!

109
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:21,260
You can't finish him off with that.

110
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:24,390
A goblin mask!

111
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:27,640
I didn't hear his footsteps!

112
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:31,900
H-How can I finish him off?

113
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:33,770
Don't ask me!

114
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:37,400
Can't you use your own head
to figure that out?

115
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,030
If stabbing's no good,

116
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,450
I'll have to crush his head!

117
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:55,920
To crush his skull
and smash it completely,

118
00:10:56,210 --> 00:10:59,300
I guess I'm going to have to pound him
with this rock many times.

119
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:01,640
I bet he's going to suffer.

120
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:05,930
Isn't there anything I can use
to kill him with one blow?

121
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,360
This kid isn't going to cut it.

122
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:18,110
He's too kind and can't make decisions.

123
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:23,120
He's facing a demon,
yet the scent of kindness remains.

124
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:26,200
He has empathy for even a demon.

125
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:29,210
Giyu...

126
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:32,460
He's never going to make it.

127
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:41,010
I blacked out.

128
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:43,720
Is my body dead, then?

129
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:46,390
I feel sick!

130
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:51,480
You bastard, I'll kill you!
I swear I'll devour you!

131
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,270
Get over here! Dammit!

132
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:56,570
I can't go to you, so you come to me!

133
00:11:56,020 --> 00:12:00,860
I faltered too long.
Now the sun's coming up!

134
00:11:56,570 --> 00:11:57,980
Hey, are you listening, brat?

135
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:00,860
Hey, come here, you!

136
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:02,450
Are you listening, you brat?

137
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:18,170
He's gone with that much sunlight?!

138
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:20,590
No wonder Nezuko shrinks from it!

139
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:23,970
Nezuko?

140
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:25,720
Nezuko?

141
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:42,030
Nezuko...

142
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:47,120
O-Oh, that's right.

143
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:48,870
Where's that man?

144
00:12:57,630 --> 00:13:01,130
He buried the people who got killed.

145
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:07,640
Um...

146
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:12,770
I'm Sakonji Urokodaki.

147
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:16,650
I'm assuming you're the one
Giyu Tomioka sent my way.

148
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:20,320
Yes! My name is Tanjiro Kamado!

149
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:22,530
My sister's name is Nezuko, and...

150
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:24,070
Tanjiro...

151
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:28,570
What will you do
when your sister devours a human?

152
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,590
Too slow!

153
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:44,130
You're just too slow
at making decisions!

154
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:47,930
You failed to finish off that demon
before daybreak!

155
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:53,140
Do you know why you couldn't answer
my question right away?

156
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:56,020
It's because your resolve is too weak!

157
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:00,110
There are two things to do
if your sister devours a human.

158
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,820
Kill your sister!

159
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:04,360
And slit your own belly and die!

160
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:08,950
That's what it means to travel
with your sister who became a demon!

161
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:15,120
But that must never happen no matter what.
And you'd best not forget.

162
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,460
Your sister, taking the life
of an innocent person...

163
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:21,590
That's the one thing
that must never happen. Ever!

164
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:24,760
Do you understand what I'm saying?

165
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:26,090
Yes!

166
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:28,590
All right, now I'm going to test you

167
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:33,720
to see if you're fit to become
a member of the Demon Slayer Corps.

168
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:37,230
Carry your sister on your back
and follow me!

169
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:49,950
He's so fast!
Just how old is he anyway?

170
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,030
And, like earlier,

171
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,370
I'm not hearing any footsteps at all!

172
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:59,040
Nezuko, I know it must be jarring,
but please be patient!

173
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,040
Well, being patient
is all that you've ever known.

174
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Nezuko...

175
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:06,510
All your life...

176
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:10,220
You're fixing your kimono again?

177
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:13,260
I guess we'll have to buy you a new one.

178
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,720
No, no, it's all right!

179
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:18,020
This kimono's my favorite!

180
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:22,900
I'd rather the younger kids
got more food to fill them up!

181
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,650
I swear I'll turn you back into a human!

182
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:31,660
I swear I'll buy you
a beautiful kimono someday!

183
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:34,990
Everything that I couldn't do
for the others...

184
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:37,160
I'll do it all for you!

185
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:47,250
N-Now, have I...

186
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:50,380
passed the test?

187
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,930
The test starts now.

188
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:01,940
We're going to climb a mountain.

189
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:10,360
I'll make sure to take care
of your sister for you.

190
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,320
I'm counting on you, sir.

191
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:27,880
I'm so exhausted.

192
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:31,300
My legs are starting to buckle!

193
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:33,880
I'm starting to feel dizzy, too.

194
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:42,390
Now, from here, go back down to the house
at the foot of the mountain.

195
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:45,270
This time, I'm not going to wait
until daybreak!

196
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,940
Is that all?

197
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,450
I see.

198
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:59,080
He thinks I might get lost
in this thick fog.

199
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,790
I just have to get back
by daybreak, right?

200
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,250
That's easy!

201
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,130
I've got a great sense of smell!

202
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:09,040
I've already memorized
Mr. Urokodaki's scent!

203
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:21,470
Rocks?!

204
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,860
A pitfall?

205
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,410
I get it now.

206
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:40,700
So, there are traps all around!

207
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:42,950
That's the deal, huh?

208
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:45,660
Uh-oh!

209
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,670
Crap, crap, crap!

210
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:55,840
If I keep walking into traps like this,

211
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:58,090
I won't make it down the mountain
by morning!

212
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,060
And besides, this mountain...

213
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:02,720
This mountain is...

214
00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:05,680
The air's thin here!

215
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:09,360
It's way thinner here than on the mountain
where I used to live!

216
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:13,940
That's why I'm gasping for air
like this and feel so dizzy!

217
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:16,450
Will I make it back?

218
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:18,280
I might pass out!

219
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:19,870
No!

220
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:21,580
I gotta make it back!

221
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:24,450
Get your breathing under control...

222
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:27,040
and sniff out each of those traps!

223
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:54,360
Right! I've got it! I've got it!

224
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:56,860
Traps set by human hands

225
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:59,700
have a slightly different smell after all!

226
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,370
But that doesn't mean...

227
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,250
I'm suddenly athletic enough

228
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:14,920
to dodge every one of them!

229
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:18,760
I'm gonna make it back
no matter what!

230
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:21,340
Nezuko!

231
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:54,130
I... have... returned.

232
00:19:57,090 --> 00:20:00,380
Forgive my abruptness,
Mr. Sakonji Urokodaki.

233
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:06,560
I'm sending a boy your way who wants
to become a Demon Slayer swordsman.

234
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:11,560
He was brazen enough
to attack me unarmed.

235
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,980
His family was slaughtered by a demon,

236
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:18,230
and the surviving younger sister
has become one,

237
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:21,700
but I have determined
that she will not attack humans.

238
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:28,290
I can sense something different
about these two.

239
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:33,000
Like yourself, the boy seems
to have a keen sense of smell.

240
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:40,050
Perhaps he'll find a way to break through
and become your heir apparent.

241
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:43,590
I am asking you to train him.

242
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:47,850
I realize that this is
a self-serving request,

243
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:50,020
but please forgive me.

244
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:57,690
I hope that you will take good care
of yourself in your endeavors.

245
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:00,440
Yours truly...

246
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:02,700
Giyu Tomioka.

247
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,920
I accept you as my student,

248
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:25,430
Tanjiro Kamado.

249
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:15,870
PREVIEW

250
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:15,870
RUSTLE RUSTLE

251
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:06,190
The demon in the temple surprised us
quite a bit, right?

252
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:08,740
I never expected
to see arms grow from his head.

253
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:14,870
Now that I'm accepted
by Mr. Urokodaki, I'll do my best!

254
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:19,120
Now, it's time for a Taisho secret!

255
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:23,590
Mr. Urokodaki with the goblin mask...
Believe it or not, his age is—

256
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:24,380
Tanjiro!

257
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:25,130
Yes?

258
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:28,470
Which do you want for dinner?
Nikujaga or oden?

259
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:30,510
Huh? Well...

260
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:32,010
Too slow to decide!

261
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:33,550
I want oden!

262
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,430
Next, Episode 3, "Sabito and Makomo"!

263
00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:40,020
TO BE CONTINUED
