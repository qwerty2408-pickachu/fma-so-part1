You know,
according to one theory,

00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:38,617
the reason you see images
like that just before death

62
00:03:38,752 --> 00:03:41,686
is because you're searching
for a way to avoid death

you slowed the poison

by adjusting your breathing.

68
00:03:57,904 --> 00:03:59,772
If you weren't able to do that,

00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:02,174
you would have already

then I'll just
have to meet him head-on!

to let me get close.

However,
your fate now is death,

She has her own will
and feelings!

166
00:08:52,999 --> 00:08:55,134
There's no way
she'll ever be your sister!

167
00:08:56,336 --> 00:08:58,070
Rui: It's all right.

168
00:08:58,205 --> 00:08:59,938
You don't need to worry.

169
00:09:00,074 --> 00:09:02,074
I'm stronger than you.

170
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:06,678
I will create a bond with her,
one made of terror.

171
00:09:06,813 --> 00:09:09,013
She'll know what happens
when I'm defied.

172
00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:11,750
Tanjiro: I've had enough of you
spouting this nonsense!

173
00:09:11,752 --> 00:09:14,219
Using fear to keep someone
shackled to you

174
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:16,621
isn't the bond of a family,

175
00:09:16,623 --> 00:09:19,758
and until you are able
to figure that out,

176
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,960
you'll never get
what it is you desire!

177
00:09:22,096 --> 00:09:24,763
Rui: So irritating.

178
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:26,899
Would you mind not shouting?

179
00:09:27,033 --> 00:09:29,501
It's clear we don't agree.

180
00:09:31,705 --> 00:09:34,239
¶

181
00:09:34,374 --> 00:09:37,576
Tanjiro: I'll never
hand Nezuko over to you!

182
00:09:37,578 --> 00:09:39,311
Rui: Very well, then.

183
00:09:39,446 --> 00:09:41,179
I'll just kill you.

184
00:09:41,181 --> 00:09:44,516
Tanjiro: Not if I manage
to cut your head off first!

185
00:09:44,651 --> 00:09:46,919
Rui: Now, that's the spirit.

186
00:09:47,053 --> 00:09:49,588
I would love to see you try it.

187
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:53,325
Let's see if you can
take down a being like me,

188
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:54,526
one of the Twelve Kizuki.

189
00:09:56,297 --> 00:09:58,764
I: In a family,

190
00:09:58,899 --> 00:10:02,834
the Father has
his designated role to fulfill,

191
00:10:02,836 --> 00:10:06,972
and the Mother has hers in turn.

192
00:10:06,974 --> 00:10:10,041
The parents protect
their eldest children,

193
00:10:10,177 --> 00:10:13,378
and the eldest
protect the younger ones.

194
00:10:13,514 --> 00:10:16,115
This is carried out,
no matter what,

195
00:10:16,249 --> 00:10:18,250
even at the risk
of their own lives.

196
00:10:19,386 --> 00:10:21,520
The way I see it,

197
00:10:21,655 --> 00:10:24,790
if you don't understand
your own role in this life,

198
00:10:24,925 --> 00:10:27,059
there's no reason
in living it to begin with.

199
00:10:28,996 --> 00:10:33,464
As for you,
I'll tell you your role.

200
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:36,201
It is to relinquish
your younger sister to me

201
00:10:36,203 --> 00:10:37,936
and disappear.

202
00:10:38,071 --> 00:10:40,939
If you refuse,
your only other path is death,

203
00:10:41,074 --> 00:10:42,975
for you cannot defeat me.

204
00:10:45,346 --> 00:10:47,946
Tanjiro: His eye
says "lower five."

205
00:10:48,081 --> 00:10:49,548
As I thought.

206
00:10:49,683 --> 00:10:52,484
This power--
he really is one of the twelve.

207
00:10:54,355 --> 00:10:56,955
It won't be easy
to cut those threads,

208
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:59,891
but what do I do
if his neck is even tougher?

209
00:11:00,027 --> 00:11:02,427
Not to mention my broken sword.

210
00:11:02,563 --> 00:11:05,364
Rui: That steely look
in your eyes,

211
00:11:05,499 --> 00:11:07,098
I don't like it.

212
00:11:07,234 --> 00:11:08,967
What are you plotting?

213
00:11:09,102 --> 00:11:10,235
Don't tell me...

214
00:11:10,371 --> 00:11:14,105
That you think
you'll be able to defeat me!

215
00:11:14,241 --> 00:11:15,174
( Tanjiro gasps )

216
00:11:15,308 --> 00:11:17,376
¶

217
00:11:17,511 --> 00:11:18,377
Nezuko!

218
00:11:20,113 --> 00:11:21,380
Rui: It's settled.

219
00:11:21,515 --> 00:11:22,981
I'll be taking her.

220
00:11:23,116 --> 00:11:25,450
You understand your role now,
don't you?

221
00:11:25,586 --> 00:11:26,985
Tanjiro: Let her go!

222
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,854
Rui: Did I not I tell you

223
00:11:28,856 --> 00:11:31,857
that I'd spare your life
in return for your obedience?

224
00:11:31,859 --> 00:11:33,025
( Nezuko growls )

231
00:11:51,078 --> 00:11:53,846

( Nezuko whimpers )

233
00:12:01,088 --> 00:12:02,821
Rui: Quiet down.

234
00:12:02,956 --> 00:12:05,023
This won't be enough
to kill her.

235
00:12:05,158 --> 00:12:07,226
She's a Demon.

236
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,429
But it does appear
I'll have to teach her a lesson.

237
00:12:10,564 --> 00:12:13,031
I'm going to let her bleed
for a while.

238
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:15,767
If she won't learn
to be obedient,

239
00:12:15,903 --> 00:12:18,437
I'll just leave her like that
until daybreak

240
00:12:18,572 --> 00:12:20,972
and then let her burn.

241
00:12:21,108 --> 00:12:22,708
Tanjiro: I won't allow it!

242
00:12:22,843 --> 00:12:24,243
Let her go!

243
00:12:26,179 --> 00:12:28,113

( Panting )

248
00:12:47,334 --> 00:12:51,402
Rui: Now, I may be
mistaken here...

249
00:12:51,404 --> 00:12:54,073
But you think,
if you get close enough to me,

250
00:12:54,207 --> 00:12:56,141
you can chop my head off,
don't you?

251
00:13:00,281 --> 00:13:02,281
Well, then, here.

252
00:13:02,415 --> 00:13:03,382
Give it a shot.

Rui: Didn't I tell you?

258
00:13:19,366 --> 00:13:22,201
You have no chance against me.

259
00:13:29,242 --> 00:13:30,976
My body is more durable

260
00:13:30,978 --> 00:13:34,179
than any of the threads
I can manipulate.

261
00:13:34,181 --> 00:13:36,315
If you can't even cut
those threads,

262
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:39,118
then you'll never
be able to cut my neck.

263

( Thinking )
He's incredibly strong.

266
00:13:51,264 --> 00:13:55,734
His strength is beyond any other
Demon I've fought so far.

267
00:13:55,869 --> 00:13:59,204
So this is the might
of the Twelve Kizuki,

268
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:03,742
the power of a Demon
closely related to Kibutsuji.

I'm her elder brother,

she cease that noise.

¶

279
00:14:25,098 --> 00:14:27,966
calm down. Don't get emotional.

280
00:14:28,101 --> 00:14:30,769
If you do, you'll play
right into his hands.

Did she pass out?

This Demon has a unique aura.

I haven't seen
anything quite like it.

Fascinating.

with each rotation.

This could be worrisome.

I can defeat him!

are at maximum strength, do you?

I can't get enough rotations in
to cut away these threads.

311

They're giving off
a totally different scent

00:16:55,582 --> 00:16:59,118
That is
your Father's kagura dance.

331
00:16:59,252 --> 00:17:01,720
Our family works with fire,

332
00:17:01,855 --> 00:17:04,323
so to ward off
injuries and disasters,

333
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:06,725
we offer this dance to hinokami

334
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:09,795
along with our prayers
at the start of each year.

335
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:11,397
( Bells rattling )

336
00:17:15,202 --> 00:17:16,935
Tanjiro: Um, mommy?

337
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:18,337
Kie: Hmm?

338
00:17:18,472 --> 00:17:20,872
Tanjiro: Father's always
been pretty sick, right?

339
00:17:21,008 --> 00:17:23,008
So how can he be
out in the snow

340
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:25,144
and still
keep dancing and dancing?

341
00:17:26,347 --> 00:17:28,079
If that were me,

342
00:17:28,215 --> 00:17:30,182
I bet my lungs would freeze.

343
00:17:32,353 --> 00:17:35,887
Tanjuro: There exists
a breathing technique,

344
00:17:35,889 --> 00:17:39,158
one that will prevent you
from ever exhausting yourself.

345
00:17:39,292 --> 00:17:41,160
Tanjiro: Really?

346
00:17:41,294 --> 00:17:42,361
Tanjuro: Yes.

347
00:17:42,496 --> 00:17:45,764
If you can master
the correct way to breathe,

348
00:17:45,899 --> 00:17:48,367
you'll be able
to dance forever, too.

349
00:17:48,502 --> 00:17:50,903
Even the cold won't bother you.

350
00:17:52,305 --> 00:17:54,173
Tanjiro...

351
00:17:54,307 --> 00:17:58,177
This ceremonial dance
and pair of earrings,

352
00:17:58,311 --> 00:18:01,046
I wish for them
to be passed down to you.

353
00:18:01,182 --> 00:18:04,249
This is my gift.

354
00:18:04,385 --> 00:18:05,384

( Tanjiro inhales )

357
00:18:09,122 --> 00:18:11,657
Hinokami kagura...

358
00:18:13,994 --> 00:18:15,861
Dance!

359
00:18:15,996 --> 00:18:17,830
Rui: My threads. ( Gasps )

360
00:18:22,069 --> 00:18:25,004
Tanjiro: Don't stop.
Keep running!

361
00:18:25,138 --> 00:18:26,538
If you hesitate

362
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:29,340
and switch between
different breathing techniques,

363
00:18:29,476 --> 00:18:31,810
there'll be repercussions!

364
00:18:31,945 --> 00:18:35,114
If that happens, I'll be
rendered immobile for a time!

365
00:18:36,483 --> 00:18:40,151
That's why
I need to keep pressing on!

366
00:18:40,287 --> 00:18:43,488
Run!
You have to protect Nezuko!

367
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:45,357
( Yelling )

368
00:18:52,032 --> 00:18:52,965
Rui: How?

369
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:03,442
( Thread rings )

370
00:19:03,577 --> 00:19:06,044
Tanjiro: I see it,
the opening thread!

371
00:19:06,179 --> 00:19:08,513
You have to take him down now,

372
00:19:08,515 --> 00:19:13,285
even if it means
getting slashed in the process!

373
00:19:15,456 --> 00:19:18,023
Kie: Nezuko. Nezuko.

374
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:21,894
Wake up, Nezuko.

375
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:25,864
You need to save your brother.

376
00:19:25,999 --> 00:19:27,700
You're capable of doing so.

377
00:19:29,136 --> 00:19:30,202
I know you are.

378
00:19:37,611 --> 00:19:40,011
Nezuko, help him.

379
00:19:40,147 --> 00:19:43,415
Your brother will be killed
if you don't!

380
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:44,549
( Nezuko growls )

381
00:19:44,551 --> 00:19:46,017
( Woman singing in Japanese )

382
00:19:46,153 --> 00:19:48,220
Nezuko: Blood Demon art.

383
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:51,256
Exploding blood!

384
00:19:54,161 --> 00:19:55,828
( Rui gasps )

385
00:20:00,367 --> 00:20:02,101
Impossible!

386
00:20:02,235 --> 00:20:04,369
The threads were burned away?

387
00:20:04,505 --> 00:20:07,306
Tanjiro: The bond
between Nezuko and I

388
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:11,176
cannot be severed,
not by anyone!

389
00:20:11,312 --> 00:20:13,946
