3
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,340
Let's go.

4
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:11,270
DESTROY

5
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:09,940
The Demon Slayer Corps has
around several hundred members.

6
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:14,360
It's an organization
unrecognized by the government.

7
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:20,490
Yet it's existed since ancient times,
and we continue to hunt demons today.

8
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:24,990
But as for who's leading
the Demon Slayer Corps,

9
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,500
that remains a mystery.

10
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:29,500
Demons.

11
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,130
Staple food... Humans!

12
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,840
They kill humans and feed on them.

13
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:38,300
No one knows when and where
they first appeared.

14
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:43,470
Their physical prowess is remarkable.
Wounds heal in the blink of an eye.

15
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:46,140
Flesh is restored after being hacked off,

16
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:49,440
and limbs can be newly regenerated.

17
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:53,690
Some demons can shape-shift.
Others have otherworldly powers.

18
00:02:54,060 --> 00:03:00,280
They can only be killed by sunlight
or by decapitation with a special sword.

19
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:04,910
The Demon Slayers battle the demons
with their own mortal bodies.

20
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:08,580
Since they're human,
their wounds are slow to heal,

21
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:11,710
and, once lost,
their limbs don't grow back!

22
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:14,540
Even so, they battle the demons...

23
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:17,460
to protect other humans.

24
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:24,550
EPISODE 3:
SABITO AND MAKOMO

25
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:33,100
I am a trainer.

26
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:36,480
I literally train swordsmen.

27
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,820
There are many trainers,

28
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:44,110
and each of them trains their pupils
with their own regimen in their location.

29
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,530
To join the Demon Slayer Corps,

30
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:52,670
you must survive the Final Selection
process held on Mt. Fujikasane.

31
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:57,130
Whether or not you're eligible
for Final Selection is up to me.

32
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:02,880
Starting today, I'm going to keep
a journal for Nezuko.

33
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:05,760
I'm descending the mountain again today.

34
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:09,970
I'm going to train my hardest
so I won't die during Final Selection.

35
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:16,940
After repeatedly descending
the mountain, day after day,

36
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:20,190
I'm starting to learn
how to avoid most of the traps.

37
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:23,030
It's because I'm much stronger now,

38
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:28,370
and because I'm even more adept
at detecting scents than before.

39
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:30,950
Even so...

40
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:35,790
the traps are getting
more and more difficult.

41
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,420
He may really want to kill me!

42
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:54,600
I made my descent today,
sword in hand,

43
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,980
but the sword really hampered
my movement.

44
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:02,440
With the sword,

45
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:04,650
I can't stop getting ensnared
in all the traps!

46
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:07,820
991!

47
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,200
I swing the sword today.

48
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:14,080
Well, it's not just today. I've been swinging
the sword every single day.

49
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:17,960
After descending the mountain,
I swing my sword until my arms nearly fall off.

50
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,080
1,000!

51
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,800
500 more!

52
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:39,310
Swords break easily.

53
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:41,900
That's what he told me beforehand.

54
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:47,740
Though it's strong vertically,
it's weak horizontally, so...

55
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:52,830
you need to apply the force
straight along the blade.

56
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:57,790
The blade's direction and the direction
in which you apply the force

57
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,170
must be exactly the same.

58
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:05,920
And he added, "If you ever damage
the blade, in other words, break it,

59
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:10,640
I'll snap your bones, as well"
in a threatening tone of voice.

60
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:15,390
Nezuko...

61
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:17,890
I'll keep working hard, okay?

62
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:36,080
Today, I did nothing but fall.

63
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:41,920
Training to break my fall
and get up quickly from any position.

64
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,090
I wield my sword,

65
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,340
and I charge Mr. Urokodaki
really trying to kill him.

66
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:48,590
In contrast,

67
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:51,760
Mr. Urokodaki is bare-handed
and unarmed.

68
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,680
But he's ridiculously powerful!

69
00:06:57,390 --> 00:07:01,350
He flings me away
to roll on the ground every time.

70
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:08,110
I'm home, Nezuko.

71
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:22,120
Today, I learned breathing
techniques and some forms.

72
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:25,380
Total Concentration Breathing?

73
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,000
That's right.

74
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:31,880
And I'm going to teach you
all ten of the Water Breathing forms.

75
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:38,970
Remember to take a long breath
so the oxygen flows into every cell in your body.

76
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:41,690
This will enhance
your body's natural healing power,

77
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:44,810
and both stabilize
and energize your spirit.

78
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:48,400
Relax your upper body

79
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:51,650
while bracing your lower half.

80
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:53,410
All right, breathe!

81
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:00,000
Wrong!

82
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,670
Next! Forms!

83
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:06,090
Right! Like this?

84
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:07,250
Wrong!

85
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:08,300
Like this?

86
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:09,260
Wrong!

87
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:09,960
This?

88
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:10,760
Wrong!

89
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:11,510
This?

90
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:12,340
Wrong!

91
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:15,640
I get yelled at
for not bracing my stomach

92
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,600
and clobbered to a pulp.

93
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:22,600
Next, he told me
to become one with the water.

94
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:24,770
Get in there!

95
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:34,530
Nezuko!

96
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:44,250
Nezuko! I am water!

97
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:51,090
And now it's been six months
since Nezuko was last awake.

98
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:55,470
Mr. Urokodaki summoned the doctor
right away and had him examine her,

99
00:08:55,890 --> 00:08:57,390
but he found nothing wrong.

100
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:01,850
But it's not normal for her
to stay asleep like this.

101
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:08,110
I was scared.

102
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:10,400
I worry that one morning,

103
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:13,940
I'll wake up to find her dead.

104
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,620
Not a day goes by that I don't worry.

105
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,040
My descents are getting more dangerous,

106
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:32,050
and the air's even thinner where I train.

107
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,930
Time and time again,
I think I might die.

108
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:01,660
I have nothing more to teach you.

109
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:05,040
A year after I arrived at Mt. Sagiri,

110
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,160
he told me all of a sudden...

111
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:10,790
The rest is up to you!

112
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:14,920
Whether or not you can improve
to the next level.

113
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:20,430
Come with me!

114
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:41,070
If you can slice this boulder,

115
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:44,450
I will allow you to enter Final Selection.

116
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,460
Is a boulder...

117
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:52,920
something you slice?

118
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:55,460
Something you can slice with a sword?

119
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:57,970
I don't think I can do it.

120
00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:00,470
My sword will snap!

121
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:08,350
Mr. Urokodaki, please wait!

122
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,230
Mr. Urokodaki!

123
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:17,320
After that, Mr. Urokodaki
never taught me anything again.

124
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,390
Every day,

125
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:48,220
I practiced over and over
what I'd learned from Mr. Urokodaki.

126
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,360
The basics like holding the breath
and flexibility...

127
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,860
I was glad I had written those
down in my journal.

128
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,120
But...

129
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:16,130
even after six months had passed,
I still couldn't slice the boulder.

130
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,250
I felt frustrated.

131
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:19,340
Not enough!

132
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,420
I wasn't training hard enough!

133
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:23,260
I gotta do more!

134
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:24,720
More!

135
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:33,810
Am I...

136
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:35,690
hopeless?

137
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:38,820
Is Nezuko going to die
without ever waking up?

138
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:43,740
I'll almost give in! I'm breaking down!!

139
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:47,320
Keep working, Tanjiro! You can do it!!

140
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:49,790
Shut up!

141
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:58,630
A man shouldn't whine.
It's unseemly.

142
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:00,380
When did he show up?

143
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:03,470
There's no scent. A fox mask?

144
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:06,720
Now matter how you suffer,
bear it in silence...

145
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:09,470
if you're a man.

146
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,810
If you call yourself a man.

147
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,320
Slow.

148
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:24,700
Weak.

149
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:26,160
Immature.

150
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:30,160
That's not what you call a man.

151
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:36,000
DEMON SLAYER:
KIMETSU NO YAIBA

152
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
DEMON SLAYER:
KIMETSU NO YAIBA

153
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:43,920
What are you doing?

154
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:47,430
I'd like to know
what you think you're doing.

155
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:48,970
What do you mean?

156
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:50,470
I'm training.

157
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,680
How long do you plan
to keep your butt on the ground

158
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:55,430
without even taking a stance?

159
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,940
Come on. Come at me.

160
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:06,490
But you have a wooden sword,
and I have a real sword!

161
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:26,300
Well, well! Thank you
for worrying about me.

162
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,930
So, you think
you're actually going to injure me!

163
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:35,640
Well, you have
absolutely nothing to worry about!

164
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:37,810
I'm more powerful than you

165
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:40,190
because I've sliced that boulder!

166
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:42,190
He's sliced that boulder?

167
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:01,880
You've learned nothing.

168
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:04,460
You haven't mastered a single thing!

169
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:08,920
Particularly, the breathing technique
Mr. Urokodaki taught you...

170
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:11,470
Total Concentration Breathing.

171
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,350
He knows Mr. Urokodaki?

172
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:16,640
And the breathing technique, too?

173
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:20,520
All you did was memorize it as fact.

174
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:23,650
Your body has no clue
what it needs to do.

175
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:28,650
What the hell were you doing
for a whole year and a half?

176
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:33,740
Slam it into your flesh!

177
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:35,450
More!

178
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:36,790
More!

179
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:37,790
More!

180
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:43,210
So that you'll never forget the secrets
Mr. Urokodaki taught you!

181
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:46,130
Pound it into the marrow of your bones!

182
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,880
I'm trying!

183
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,550
I'm trying every single day!

184
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:50,800
With everything I've got!

185
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:53,890
But I'm not making any headway!

186
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:57,430
I just can't go any further!

187
00:15:57,850 --> 00:15:58,850
Go further!

188
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:00,060
If you're a man!

189
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,190
If you call yourself a man!

190
00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:04,690
There's no other way
to go but forward!

191
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:06,150
Bring it on!

192
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:09,030
Show me what you're capable of!

193
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:28,380
I'm leaving the rest to you.

194
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:42,770
Are you all right?

195
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:47,230
Did you see that just now?

196
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:49,820
What a strike that was!

197
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:52,240
Not a single bit of wasted motion!

198
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:54,450
It was really beautiful!

199
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:59,160
I want to become like that!
You think I can become like him?

200
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,910
I'm sure you can...

201
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:05,330
since I'll be looking after you.

202
00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:11,840
She's so cute.

203
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,720
Who are you?

204
00:17:16,590 --> 00:17:19,810
This girl's name was Makomo.

205
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:23,770
She told me the boy's name was Sabito.

206
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:28,360
Makomo also pointed out my defects.

207
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:33,740
She corrected my unnecessary
movements and bad habits.

208
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:36,860
But when I asked her
why she was doing that,

209
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:40,660
and where she came from,
she didn't tell me anything.

210
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:46,290
Both he and I love
Mr. Urokodaki very much.

211
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:50,420
That was Makomo's pet phrase.

212
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:52,800
She and Sabito weren't siblings.

213
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:56,590
She said Mr. Urokodaki raised them
after they'd been orphaned.

214
00:17:57,510 --> 00:18:00,720
There are other children besides us.

215
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:03,470
They're always watching you, Tanjiro.

216
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:08,270
Makomo is a somewhat strange girl.

217
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:11,320
She speaks in such an abstract,
dreamy way.

218
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:16,860
See, Total Concentration Breathing
accelerates your blood circulation

219
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:19,780
and your heart rate.

220
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:23,200
That causes
your body temperature to spike,

221
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:26,750
making you as strong as a demon
while staying human.

222
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:30,920
The important thing
is to expand your lung capacity.

223
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:35,090
When you bring lots of air into your blood,

224
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:37,300
and when your blood gets excited,

225
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:42,050
your bones and muscles scurry
to heat up and grow stronger.

226
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,640
I'm not sure I get that.

227
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:47,600
How can I do that?

228
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:52,820
Train to death.

229
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:57,030
At the end of the day,
there's nothing else you can do.

230
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,530
Until my arms and legs
were ready to fall off...

231
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:06,790
Until my lungs and heart
were ready to burst,

232
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:08,960
I swung my sword.

233
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:10,790
But still...

234
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:14,130
I just couldn't beat Sabito.

235
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:19,630
Not until six months later.

236
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:30,730
When I challenged him that day,

237
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:33,150
Sabito was wielding a real sword.

238
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,650
After six months, finally,

239
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:39,070
you have the look of a man.

240
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:49,040
Today's the day I win!

241
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:58,960
Head-on battles are simple.

242
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:02,970
Whoever's stronger and faster wins.

243
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:17,980
The battle was over in an instant.

244
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:22,360
On this day, in this moment,
for the first time,

245
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:25,870
my blade reached Sabito first.

246
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:38,250
The moment I won,

247
00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:40,510
Sabito smiled.

248
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:44,300
He looked sad and happy.

249
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:47,140
A relieved kind of smile.

250
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:50,060
Tanjiro...

251
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:55,020
You did great.
Don't forget what you just did.

252
00:20:57,110 --> 00:20:59,190
Win, okay, Tanjiro?

253
00:20:59,610 --> 00:21:01,030
Beat that guy, too.

254
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:08,950
The next thing I knew,

255
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:10,950
Sabito was gone.

256
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:16,750
And my sword, which I was sure
had slashed Sabito's mask...

257
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:27,470
...had sliced the boulder.

258
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:14,290
PREVIEW

259
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:14,290
RUSTLE RUSTLE

260
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:06,570
Yeah, I was shocked, too!

261
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:08,570
I could never imagine
I'd be able to cut a boulder like that.

262
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:10,910
I couldn't have done it
without Sabito and Makomo.

263
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,660
I can't thank them enough.

264
00:23:14,290 --> 00:23:17,120
Now, it's time for a Taisho secret!

265
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:20,120
Why does Mr. Urokodaki wear a mask?

266
00:23:20,370 --> 00:23:25,800
I heard that's because demons used to make fun
of his face for looking too kind.

267
00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:28,970
Sabito, Makomo and Mr. Urokodaki!

268
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:33,100
I'll work harder
to turn Nezuko back into a human!

269
00:23:34,430 --> 00:23:37,060
Next, Episode 4, "Final Selection"!

270
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:39,980
TO BE CONTINUED
