1
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:05,690
How should we kill them, I wonder.

2
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:09,570
I can feel the flow of power.

3
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:13,570
Because of all the blood
he shared with me.

4
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:18,530
Of course we're going to
slay them vindictively.

5
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:21,120
Get down!

7
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:36,300
Did you decide how to kill them?

8
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:38,680
Vindictively, of course!

9
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:30,000
EPISODE 9:
TEMARI DEMON AND ARROW DEMON

10
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:46,270
You were right, Yahaba!

11
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,350
A building just appeared out of nowhere!

12
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:56,400
The handiwork of a Blood Demon Arts
wielder adept at hiding objects.

13
00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:01,700
And is the demon hunter
accompanied by a demon?

14
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,780
What's going on here?

15
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:07,040
Isn't this fun?

16
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:10,500
Still, I have to say, Susamaru...

17
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:13,960
Your way of doing things
is so immature.

18
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:16,170
So careless.

19
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:17,710
You splattered me!

20
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:20,470
You splattered my kimono with dust!

21
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:23,140
Oh, stop whining!

22
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:27,770
We found them right away
thanks to my temari, so who cares?

23
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:30,140
And now we can have tons of fun!

24
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,280
You've gone and splattered me again!

25
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:40,070
You're so uptight.

26
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,740
Your kimono isn't the least bit soiled.

27
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,660
And besides...

28
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:53,960
Found 'em! Found 'em!

29
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:56,170
A temari!

30
00:03:57,090 --> 00:03:58,250
So, she caused all this damage

31
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,460
by throwing that temari?

32
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:04,180
That woman...

33
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:06,140
Is she one of Kibutsuji's minions?

34
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,190
Lady Tamayo!

35
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:27,950
Yushiro!

36
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,080
Dammit!

37
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:32,040
Nezuko!

38
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:36,330
Take the lady sleeping in the back room
somewhere safe outside!

39
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:39,090
It's too dangerous outside!

40
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:41,340
We have a basement, so take her there!

41
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:42,670
Understood!

42
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:44,010
Nezuko!

43
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,600
That's one down!

44
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,230
She's giving off a totally different scent
than any of the other demons!

45
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:58,400
Is it stronger?
It's a really thick scent!

46
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,730
It feels so heavy
once it enters my lungs!

47
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:13,750
The demon hunter
wearing hanafuda-like earrings...

48
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,710
It's you, isn't it?

49
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:18,420
So, I'm the one they're targeting?

50
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:20,130
Miss Tamayo!

51
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:22,550
Please find a place to hide!

52
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,920
I'm the one those demons are after!

53
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:29,720
Tanjiro, I want you to fight
without worrying about us.

54
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:32,350
We'll be fine without your protection.

55
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:36,390
Since we're demons.

56
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,480
All right.

57
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:42,270
It's all over for you now!

58
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:48,490
That temari will only swerve if I dodge it.

59
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,920
Of the ten forms...

60
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:01,420
The fastest thrusting technique...

61
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,210
Total Concentration...

62
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:04,920
Water Breathing!

63
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:06,340
Seventh Form,

64
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,470
Drop Ripple Thrust-curve!

65
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:17,730
Oh, so you thrust at the curve diagonally
to soften the temari's blow.

66
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:19,940
But...

67
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:26,990
How can that temari
move around like that?

68
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:29,660
It swerved unnaturally

69
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:31,950
when it struck Yushiro, as well!

70
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:35,790
It's not like it's spinning
in any special way, and yet...

71
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,200
What is this?

72
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:42,960
Yushiro!

73
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,250
Yushiro!

74
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,770
La...

75
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:00,770
Lady Tamayo!

76
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:03,270
Didn't I tell you?

77
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:06,070
That we shouldn't get involved
with that demon hunter!

78
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,690
From the start!

79
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:11,490
My Blindfold technique
is still a work in progress!

80
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:14,780
I know you're well aware
of that yourself!

81
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:18,290
I may be able to conceal the presence
of buildings and people, their scent,

82
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:21,170
but it's not like I can mask
their very existence!

83
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:25,670
The greater our numbers,
the more traces we'll leave,

84
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:28,880
and the greater the odds
that Kibutsuji will discover us!

85
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:32,180
Those demons got this close to us,

86
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:34,890
yet there was no scent
until we came under attack!

87
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:38,350
That was Yushiro's Blood Demon Art, huh?

88
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:43,060
Anyone who ruins the time
I spend alone with you...

89
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,190
I despise such people!

90
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:47,940
I despise them with passion!

91
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:50,950
It's unforgivable!

92
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,120
Hey, he's babbling!

93
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:59,290
What fun this is!

94
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:01,160
What fun this is!

95
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:05,040
To be killed by me,
one of the Twelve Demon Moons...

96
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:07,550
You should be honored!

97
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:10,050
Twelve Demon Moons?

98
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:12,630
They serve directly under Kibutsuji!

99
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:22,560
She grew more arms!

100
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:30,360
Now then, let's keep playing!

101
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:32,400
Until morning comes!

102
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:34,660
Until you die!

103
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:46,630
If I were to cast my spell now,

104
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,920
it would affect Tanjiro, as well.

105
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:53,260
And Yushiro needs time to prepare
to switch to attack mode.

106
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:55,510
But if this goes on...

107
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:00,060
There it is again!

108
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:03,100
Even without hitting anything,
they changed trajectory!

109
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:10,400
If I go ahead and slash them,
it blunts the blow,

110
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:12,650
but then they hit me anyway!

111
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,660
Two different scents of blood.

112
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:20,780
There are two demons!

113
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,000
Their scent tells me where they are!

114
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:24,960
But...

115
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:31,670
Miss Tamayo! Yushiro!

116
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:34,170
It's no good!

117
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:36,300
I don't have time to protect them!

118
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:39,180
We'll be healed soon enough!

119
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:40,680
So don't worry!

120
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,850
Hey! Moron demon hunter!

121
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:45,980
If you look at the arrows,
you can tell which direction they're going!

122
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:47,730
Dodge the arrows!

123
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,520
Arrows?

124
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:53,820
Seriously, you can't even see them?

125
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,360
I'm going to lend you
my sense of sight!

126
00:09:56,650 --> 00:09:59,820
That should at least enable you
to behead that temari woman!

127
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:13,630
I can see now!

128
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,220
She was using these arrows to control...

129
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:19,970
...the trajectory of the temari!

130
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:24,520
Thanks, Yushiro!

131
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:26,680
I can see the arrows now, too!

132
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,020
Then, hurry up and defeat her!

133
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,310
Nezuko!

134
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:32,980
Nezuko, let's go outside!

135
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:35,190
Take care of the demon up in the tree!

136
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:46,200
I'm the one you want to take on!

137
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:51,540
The demon hunter
wearing hanafuda-like earrings...

138
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:53,130
No question.

139
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:57,050
I'm going to bring
that head of yours to him.

140
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:02,550
What fun this is!

141
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,560
Nezuko, how much longer?

142
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:25,830
They're gone!

143
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,410
Water Breathing...

144
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:40,130
Third Form, Flowing Dance!

145
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:45,300
Miss Tamayo!

146
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:48,810
Are these two demons
closely related to Kibutsuji?

147
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,480
Most likely.

148
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:55,270
Then, I'm going to extract blood
from them for sure!

149
00:11:56,980 --> 00:12:00,990
DEMON SLAYER:
KIMETSU NO YAIBA

150
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:04,990
DEMON SLAYER:
KIMETSU NO YAIBA

151
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,870
I have two favors to ask of you.

152
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:16,590
One, permission to study
your sister's blood.

153
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:21,510
Two, to retrieve
blood samples from demons

154
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:24,390
as closely related to Kibutsuji
as possible.

155
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:27,390
By "demons closely related to Kibutsuji,"

156
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:33,640
I meant demons whose powers are more
on par with that of Kibutsuji himself.

157
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:37,610
It won't be easy to extract blood
from such demons.

158
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:43,490
Third Form, Flowing Dance!

159
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:48,660
Miss Tamayo!

160
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:52,160
Are these two demons
closely related to Kibutsuji?

161
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:53,830
Most likely.

162
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:08,600
You think you're going to extract
blood from us?

163
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:12,060
I don't know what you're scheming,

164
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:16,900
but I won't allow you
to do anything to displease him!

165
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:24,110
If you think you can extract blood
from us Twelve Demon Moons,

166
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,030
then have at it!

167
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:27,780
Watch your back!

168
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:30,160
Don't let your guard down for a second!

169
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:33,000
If those two really are Twelve Demon Moons,

170
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:37,960
then they're undeniably more formidable
than any other demon you've killed until now!

171
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:40,090
Right! Understood!

172
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:43,210
Watch my back, don't let
my guard down for a second,

173
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:44,340
undeniably...

174
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:45,880
until now...

175
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:47,640
Right! I'll do my best!

176
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:49,760
Lady Tamayo!

177
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,680
Let's use those two as decoys
and escape!

178
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,890
I'm just kidding!

179
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:05,780
Don't stir up dust like that.

180
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:07,530
So filthy!

181
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:24,840
She grew new arms
in such a short time!

182
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:29,180
She can regenerate way faster
than those Final Selection demons!

183
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:34,600
I'm going to bring
that head of yours to him.

184
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,230
Nezuko!

185
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:50,240
Now then, why don't you both die at once?

186
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:56,410
Are you okay, Nezuko?

187
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:58,290
Hey, Demon Hunter!

188
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:01,670
You get rid of that arrow man first!

189
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,630
We'll take on the temari woman
with your sister!

190
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,260
Understood!

191
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:09,760
Nezuko, whatever you do,
don't push yourself too hard.

192
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:25,900
I'm counting on you.

193
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:28,190
I swear...

194
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,030
I'm going to extract their blood!

195
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:33,370
If it means the medicine will be perfected
even a minute sooner,

196
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:35,450
I'll gladly fight any demon!

197
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:37,370
I'll fight and win!

198
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:41,290
There it is!

199
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,540
Opening Thread!

200
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:47,420
What a grimy little urchin you are.

201
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:49,300
You stay away from me!

202
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:54,800
The thread snapped!

203
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,240
This hurts! I mean this really...

204
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:14,870
It seriously hurts!

205
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:26,630
A move!

206
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:31,010
Unleash a move to blunt the attack!

207
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:32,800
Eighth Form,

208
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:34,260
Waterfall Basin!

209
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,410
He vanished?

210
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,540
You hurt Lady Tamayo!

211
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:09,880
I'll never forgive you for that!

212
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:12,090
Tamayo?

213
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:15,130
Hey, Susamaru, the one over there...

214
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:17,600
Wouldn't that be Tamayo the Fugitive?

215
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:20,390
What a great souvenir she'll make!

216
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,640
Is that right?

217
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:27,900
Idiot!

218
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:29,190
You mustn't kick it!

219
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:41,370
What fun this is!

220
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:43,160
What fun this is!

221
00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:45,920
I like kemari, too!

222
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,130
Yahaba!

223
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:51,920
Will four heads be enough to take home?

224
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:54,340
No. We're taking two.

225
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:57,090
The demon hunter and the fugitive.

226
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,850
We have no use for the other two.

227
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:03,470
Nezuko...

228
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,690
The bleeding isn't stopping instantly.

229
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:08,770
She's recovering so slowly.

230
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:13,820
This medicine will help heal your leg
right away, all right?

231
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,330
What should I do?

232
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:29,040
I can't lose no matter what!

233
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:34,090
But even if I can see the Opening Thread,
it won't be easy to slash him!

234
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:38,130
Any move would be pointless

235
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:41,010
unless I can land my blow
in the opening with pinpoint accuracy!

236
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:45,770
If I'm off by even a little,
the move won't be nearly as potent!

237
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:50,650
He'll only change the sword's direction
using his arrow skills!

238
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,650
And I hate to say it,

239
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,780
but those eyeballs
on his hands are creepy!

240
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,650
Though I hate to say it!

241
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:08,160
The speed of this arrow!

242
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:12,040
It's not going to disappear until it hits me!

243
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,170
And I can't slash it with my sword!

244
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:16,920
The instant the blade touches it,

245
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:19,510
I'll get blasted away
in the arrow's direction!

246
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:26,850
What should I do?

247
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:38,030
It's all going the way I want it to!

248
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,240
Your arm's going to get twisted right off!

249
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:55,630
So, you eluded it by spinning in the same
direction as the Kouketsu Arrow?

250
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:57,630
Damn monkey!

251
00:19:58,550 --> 00:20:01,090
I can't take much more of his attacks!

252
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:02,800
I gotta strike back!

253
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:07,180
I gotta change the arrow's direction
without touching it directly!

254
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,430
It's about time for you to die!

255
00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:14,400
Adapt your moves!

256
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:18,530
First, use the Sixth Form
to envelope the arrow!

257
00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:24,110
Then use the footwork of the Third Form...

258
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,830
to close in on him!

259
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:32,580
Twist!

260
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:34,250
Envelope!

261
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:40,260
Twisting Whirlpool-Flowing Water!

262
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,510
My sword's so heavy!

263
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:50,180
But...

264
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:51,890
Second Form...

265
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:53,020
Modified!

266
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:56,480
Horizontal Water Wheel!

267
00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:53,930
PREVIEW

268
00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:53,930
RUSTLE RUSTLE

269
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,630
Those are some powerful demons!

270
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:50,090
Those temari-and-arrow combination attacks
are giving me so much trouble!

271
00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:52,300
Are you okay, Nezuko?

272
00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:57,690
Today, I have a Taisho secret for you
about those demons!

273
00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:01,110
Those two, Yahaba and Susamaru,
met for the first time today.

274
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:05,230
I hear that they became friends
chatting with each other on their way here.

275
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:08,990
I can't believe how much in sync
they are when they only just met!

276
00:23:09,410 --> 00:23:11,120
Well, we can't let them beat us!

277
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:13,740
Nezuko, let's practice our teamwork!

278
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:16,500
First Form!

279
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:18,750
Second Form!

280
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:21,500
Third Form!

281
00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:26,960
Looking good, Nezuko!

282
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,720
Next, Episode 10, "Together Forever."

283
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:33,600
I'm leaving the temari woman to you!

284
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:35,140
Let's fight together!

285
00:23:36,770 --> 00:23:40,060
TO BE CONTINUED
