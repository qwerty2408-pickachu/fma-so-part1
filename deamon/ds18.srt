Shinobu: Were you acquainted
with any of these Demon slayers?

3
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:14,613
There don't seem to be

any survivors in this area,
at least.

5
00:00:18,285 --> 00:00:21,886
We were informed that several
of the newer mizunoto

6
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:25,824
had joined the battle
to combat these demons, but...

7
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:28,627
They might all be dead by now,
don't you think?

8

Since we've been given
this joint mission,

12
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,906
let's try to get along, Tomioka.

is slaying demons.

Shinobu:
How coldhearted of you.

15
00:00:47,648 --> 00:00:51,583
Well, how about
we split up from this point?

16
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:53,786
I shall proceed from the west.

17

I can tell
he's about to do something

Don't move in on my prey!

This is how I'll secure
my path up the ladder,

and with more status,

165

comes more money in my pockets
from on high.

Even with most of my unit
wiped out, I'll dispose of him,

I'll descend the mountain

Don't do it!

Tanjiro: Cut to pieces
in an instant.

173
00:09:49,656 --> 00:09:51,723
How did he do that?

what did you just say?

180
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:12,745

I'm gonna need you to
hang in there a little longer.

184
00:10:23,423 --> 00:10:26,625
I'll be there as soon
as I defeat this Demon.

185

I'll come help you,
no matter what!

Rui: Answer me.
What did you mean?

187
00:10:34,434 --> 00:10:36,301
I demand to hear it from you.

188
00:10:37,571 --> 00:10:41,306
Come now. Explain it to me.

189
00:10:41,308 --> 00:10:44,576
Tanjiro: Sure! I'd be happy to.

190

how pathetic is that?

204

I've gotta find a way
to turn things around.

205

How do you cut someone
who's swordproof, anyway?

What should I do? What can I do?

This is bad!
This is really bad!

I can't let my guard down again!

Using my head?

It was as simple as that.

229

If you can't cut something
with a sword,

230
00:12:44,297 --> 00:12:47,366
all you gotta do is
pound on it with another sword!

And just my luck.
I have the tools for the job!

I'm not going to kill you
in a single strike.

242

Instead, I'll dissect you
piece by piece.

243

However, if you take back
what you said to me just now,

I'll make your death
mercifully quick.

What I said
was the unbridled truth!

This doesn't hurt at all,

it's not a problem!

I've never felt this much force

00:18:33,714 --> 00:18:35,114
( Gags )

334
00:18:35,248 --> 00:18:36,315
( Running footsteps )

335
00:18:38,852 --> 00:18:40,486
( Father groans )

336
00:18:41,922 --> 00:18:43,722
( Inosuke gags )

337
00:18:43,857 --> 00:18:45,290
What was that?

338
00:18:47,528 --> 00:18:50,729
Did he actually cut through him?

339
00:18:50,864 --> 00:18:55,367
Who--who could have
possibly done such a thing?

340
00:18:55,369 --> 00:18:57,269

341
00:19:00,741 --> 00:19:02,675
( Father growling )

342
00:19:04,678 --> 00:19:06,712
- ( Roars )
- Inosuke: So quick.

343
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:12,351
Tomioka: Water breathing.
Fourth form...

344
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:13,552
Striking tide.

345
00:19:13,687 --> 00:19:14,753
( Father groans )

346
00:19:14,888 --> 00:19:16,655
¶

347
00:19:18,892 --> 00:19:20,459
( gagging )

348
00:19:21,695 --> 00:19:24,229
Inosuke: A-amazing.

349
00:19:28,702 --> 00:19:32,504
I've--I've never seen anyone

350
00:19:32,506 --> 00:19:36,375
as incredible as this guy.

351
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:38,377
( Chorus vocalizing )

352
00:19:38,512 --> 00:19:39,278
( Tanjiro grunts )

353
00:19:43,717 --> 00:19:46,518
Good. The stench
is starting to fade,

354
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:49,088
so now I'm able to detect
the scent of the threads.

355
00:19:50,591 --> 00:19:53,324
I can take him on now.

356
00:19:53,326 --> 00:19:57,462
Rui: Hmph. He's smarter
than I gave him credit for.

357
00:19:57,598 --> 00:20:00,331
He doesn't shrink back in fear.

358
00:20:00,467 --> 00:20:03,002
Not that any of that
will matter in the end.

359
00:20:03,136 --> 00:20:04,670
¶

360
00:20:10,611 --> 00:20:13,278
Tanjiro: Water breathing.
First form...

361
00:20:14,481 --> 00:20:16,515
Water surface slash!

362
00:20:17,951 --> 00:20:19,084
( Gasps )

363
00:20:20,554 --> 00:20:21,687
( Squelch )

364
00:20:21,689 --> 00:20:22,754
