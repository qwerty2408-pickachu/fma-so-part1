2
00:00:25,108 --> 00:00:26,067
Why?

3
00:00:29,612 --> 00:00:31,656
Why did this happen?

4
00:00:34,492 --> 00:00:35,827
Nezuko, don't die on me.

5
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:36,828
Don't die.

6
00:00:39,164 --> 00:00:41,082
I'll definitely save you!

7
00:00:43,418 --> 00:00:44,502
I won't let you die.

8
00:00:46,254 --> 00:00:50,091
I'll definitely save you!

9
00:01:02,812 --> 00:01:03,855
Tanjiro.

10
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,110
Your face is dirty.

11
00:01:09,778 --> 00:01:10,987
Come over here.

12
00:01:13,823 --> 00:01:15,742
It gets dangerous because of the snow.

13
00:01:15,867 --> 00:01:17,494
It's okay if you don't go.

14
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:22,624
I want everyone to be full
during New Year.

15
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:25,168
I want to sell more charcoal.

16
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:27,504
Thank you.

17
00:01:29,547 --> 00:01:30,590
Tanjiro!

18
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:34,093
Are you going to the town today?

19
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:35,887
I want to tag along too!

20
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:38,890
You can't.

21
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:41,976
You both can't walk
as fast as Tanjiro, right?

22
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:43,603
Mom!

23
00:01:43,853 --> 00:01:44,854
No way.

24
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:47,732
We can't pull the carriage out today.

25
00:01:47,982 --> 00:01:50,777
You can't sit and rest on it.

26
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:54,614
Tanjiro!

27
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:57,700
I want to go with you.

28
00:01:58,284 --> 00:02:00,203
I'll help you sell the charcoal too.

29
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:02,622
Thank you, Hanako.

30
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:05,708
But you should stay home today.

31
00:02:09,337 --> 00:02:10,338
Shigeru too.

32
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:13,424
I'll buy delicious food for you.

33
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:14,676
Really?

34
00:02:14,926 --> 00:02:15,844
Yes.

35
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,682
Hanako, I'll read a book to you
when I return home.

36
00:02:20,932 --> 00:02:21,808
Okay.

37
00:02:22,058 --> 00:02:23,017
Good girl.

38
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:25,311
Thank you, Tanjiro.

39
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:28,231
I'll get going then.

40
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:29,816
Takeo.

41
00:02:30,066 --> 00:02:34,028
If you don't mind,
can you chop some firewood for me?

42
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:36,781
I can chop the firewood.

43
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:40,243
I just want to do it with you.

44
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:43,830
Good boy.

45
00:02:43,913 --> 00:02:45,331
What are you doing?

46
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:47,000
Takeo is embarrassed!

47
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:48,459
Shut up!

48
00:02:48,543 --> 00:02:49,752
Good boy.

49
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:51,546
Don't touch my head!

50
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:58,720
Come back quickly!

51
00:02:59,387 --> 00:03:01,097
Be careful on the road!

52
00:03:06,811 --> 00:03:07,770
Tanjiro.

53
00:03:08,938 --> 00:03:09,981
Nezuko.

54
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,567
I put Rokuta to sleep.

55
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:14,777
Or else, he'll cry and make noise.

56
00:03:15,778 --> 00:03:18,489
I think he's feeling lonely
after Dad's passing.

57
00:03:20,658 --> 00:03:24,162
That's why everyone clings to you.

58
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:28,082
Come back safely!

59
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:33,463
Living isn't easy.

60
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:35,506
But we're happy.

61
00:03:36,507 --> 00:03:39,552
But life is like the weather.

62
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:43,181
It's ever-changing.

63
00:03:44,265 --> 00:03:46,392
Sunny days won't last forever.

64
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:49,354
It won't keep on snowing too.

65
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:54,359
But when happiness comes crashing down,

66
00:03:54,817 --> 00:03:55,944
it's always

67
00:03:56,945 --> 00:03:58,529
accompanied by the smell of blood.

68
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:09,540
It's Tanjiro.

69
00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:12,418
You still came down the mountain
in this weather?

70
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:14,504
You're so hardworking.

71
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:16,422
Don't catch a cold.

72
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,174
I'm fine with this weather.

73
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:19,676
Want to buy some charcoal?

74
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:20,927
Do you have enough at home?

75
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:22,845
Hey, Tanjiro!

76
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:25,598
I want to buy charcoal.

77
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:29,435
You helped me fix my door last time.
Thank you.

78
00:04:29,727 --> 00:04:31,562
I also want to buy charcoal.

79
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:39,070
Tanjiro! You came at the right time.

80
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:42,865
I was treated as the culprit
who broke the plate.

81
00:04:43,032 --> 00:04:44,450
Please help me!

82
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:45,743
Smell it.

83
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:52,041
I smelled a cat.

84
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,710
I told you!

85
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:55,712
My goodness, it was the cat's fault.

86
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:57,672
I told you that it wasn't me!

87
00:04:58,089 --> 00:04:59,340
Tanjiro.

88
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:02,927
Could you help me move some stuff?

89
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:09,350
It's already late.

90
00:05:10,351 --> 00:05:12,812
But thank goodness,
I sold all the charcoal.

91
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:15,648
Tanjiro!

92
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:19,777
Are you going back to the mountain?

93
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:21,779
It's too dangerous. Don't go.

94
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:24,699
I have a good nose. I'll be fine.

95
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:27,285
You can stay the night here.

96
00:05:27,535 --> 00:05:28,369
Come.

97
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:29,537
Come here.

98
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:31,706
But...

99
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:33,124
Just come.

100
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,877
The demons are coming out.

101
00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:51,267
Thank you for the meal.

102
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:58,232
Well, Mr. Saburo.

103
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:00,318
What do you mean by demons?

104
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:05,364
Since a long time ago, man-eating demons
always come out after sunset.

105
00:06:08,367 --> 00:06:11,537
So, you mustn't wander outside at night.

106
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:13,581
Sleep after you're done.

107
00:06:13,831 --> 00:06:15,833
Wake up early tomorrow and go home.

108
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:24,675
The demons can't enter houses, right?

109
00:06:25,676 --> 00:06:28,096
No, they can.

110
00:06:31,849 --> 00:06:35,228
If so, everyone will be eaten
by the demons.

111
00:06:38,147 --> 00:06:41,818
That's why there are demon slayers
who help us to kill them.

112
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:43,611
They have existed a long time ago.

113
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:47,448
I'll put the light out.

114
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:48,950
Go to sleep.

115
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:56,249
Mr. Saburo's whole family passed away.
He has been living alone.

116
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:57,875
He must be lonely.

117
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:01,254
I'll bring my brothers here next time.

118
00:07:02,046 --> 00:07:03,381
There's nothing to be afraid of.

119
00:07:03,464 --> 00:07:04,715
There are no demons in this world.

120
00:07:05,049 --> 00:07:06,175
Everything will be fine.

121
00:07:07,176 --> 00:07:09,053
But come to think of it,

122
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:13,349
Grandma said similar things
before she passed away.

123
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,815
Be careful on the road.

124
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:33,119
When happiness comes crashing down,

125
00:07:34,078 --> 00:07:35,121
it's always...

126
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:43,838
The smell of blood.

127
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:08,279
Nezuko!

128
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:10,072
What's wrong?

129
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,574
What happened?

130
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:13,701
What happened here?

131
00:08:20,124 --> 00:08:21,167
Mom.

132
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:29,467
Mom.

133
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,801
Hanako.

134
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:32,762
Takeo.

135
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:34,305
Shigeru.

136
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:36,516
Nezuko.

137
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:37,725
Rokuta.

138
00:08:46,275 --> 00:08:48,236
Only Nezuko's body feels warm.

139
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,781
If I take her to the doctor,
maybe she can be saved.

140
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:54,659
Why did this happen?

141
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:57,203
Was it a bear?

142
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,539
Did the non-hibernating bear come out?

143
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:07,672
I can't breathe.

144
00:09:08,005 --> 00:09:10,508
Breathing in the cold air
is hurting my lungs.

145
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:12,927
I must move forward.

146
00:09:13,302 --> 00:09:15,221
I need to walk faster.

147
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:18,474
It's still a long way from the town.

148
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:19,725
I need to hurry.

149
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:22,353
I can't let Nezuko die.

150
00:09:25,147 --> 00:09:26,607
I'll definitely save you.

151
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,485
I will save you!

152
00:09:38,202 --> 00:09:39,161
Damn it!

153
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,631
The snow saved me.

154
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:53,509
But I slipped because of the snow too.

155
00:09:55,469 --> 00:09:56,512
Nezuko.

156
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:05,229
Nezuko, are you okay?

157
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:07,898
You don't have to walk.

158
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:10,151
I'll piggyback you to the town.

159
00:10:11,193 --> 00:10:12,236
Nezuko!

160
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:23,372
This is...

161
00:10:24,498 --> 00:10:25,625
a demon.

162
00:10:27,084 --> 00:10:29,837
Now I remember what Mr. Saburo said.

163
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:33,174
Nezuko is a man-eating demon.

164
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:34,842
It can't be.

165
00:10:34,925 --> 00:10:36,093
Nezuko is a human.

166
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:37,595
She's a human since she was born.

167
00:10:38,554 --> 00:10:42,016
But she doesn't smell
like the usual Nezuko.

168
00:10:43,392 --> 00:10:45,436
No, Nezuko didn't do that

169
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:48,230
because she protected Rokuta
and fell on the ground.

170
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:51,025
Her mouth and hands
weren't stained with blood.

171
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:53,361
Plus, there's another...

172
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:55,237
Another smell.

173
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:02,662
Nezuko's body is growing bigger!

174
00:11:04,538 --> 00:11:06,374
She's getting stronger too.

175
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:10,086
When I was sleeping comfortably
in someone else's house,

176
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:12,838
everyone was experiencing
a terrible incident.

177
00:11:13,672 --> 00:11:14,965
It must have hurt.

178
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:16,634
It must have been horrible.

179
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:20,721
I'm sorry for not saving everyone.

180
00:11:22,306 --> 00:11:24,934
But at the very least,
I can do something for Nezuko.

181
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:27,103
But she's so strong.

182
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:28,354
I can't fight back.

183
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:30,356
Nezuko!

184
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:32,149
You can do it, Nezuko!

185
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,277
Endure it! Do it for me!

186
00:11:36,904 --> 00:11:38,614
Don't become a demon!

187
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:40,241
Hang in there!

188
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:43,828
You can do it!

189
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:17,236
What happened?

190
00:12:21,615 --> 00:12:22,658
Who are you?

191
00:12:27,371 --> 00:12:28,205
A katana?

192
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:29,165
DESTROY DEMONS

193
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,000
Why did you protect her?

194
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:32,668
My younger sister.

195
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:34,295
She's my younger sister!

196
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:38,716
Nezuko!

197
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:44,472
Is that your sister?

198
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:01,489
Nezuko!

199
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:02,573
Don't move.

200
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:09,163
My job is slaying vile demons.

201
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:12,541
Of course, I also need
to chop off your sister's head.

202
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:14,418
Hang on.

203
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:16,378
Nezuko didn't kill anyone.

204
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:21,592
My house has another smell
that I have never smelled before.

205
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:23,302
It killed everyone.

206
00:13:23,552 --> 00:13:26,013
I think that must be the case!

207
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:27,973
It wasn't Nezuko!

208
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:31,060
Although I don't know
why she become like this,

209
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:32,895
but...

210
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:34,939
The reason is simple.

211
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:39,276
When the demon's blood touches
her wound, she'll become a demon.

212
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:42,988
That's how man-eating demons
grow their numbers.

213
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:46,075
Nezuko won't eat people!

214
00:13:46,742 --> 00:13:48,285
I can't believe you said that.

215
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:51,789
Weren't you almost eaten by her?

216
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:53,749
No!

217
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:56,377
Nezuko definitely recognized me.

218
00:13:57,086 --> 00:13:58,963
I won't let anyone hurt her.

219
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,298
Nezuko will become a human again.

220
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:03,259
I'll definitely cure her!

221
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:05,177
She's hopeless.

222
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:08,847
After she becomes a demon,
she can't become a human again.

223
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:10,391
I'll find it!

224
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:12,518
I'll definitely find a way.

225
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:14,895
Don't kill her!

226
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:18,065
I'll find the one who killed my family.

227
00:14:18,315 --> 00:14:20,693
I'll do all the above!

228
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:21,944
So...

229
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:23,654
So...

230
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:25,948
Don't kill her!

231
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,243
Don't take my family away from me again.

232
00:14:31,453 --> 00:14:32,872
Please stop it.

233
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:37,710
Please don't kill Nezuko.

234
00:14:38,752 --> 00:14:40,004
I'm begging you.

235
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:42,965
Please.

236
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:54,852
Don't let another person take control
of your right to live or die!

237
00:14:56,478 --> 00:14:58,981
Don't beg others pitifully!

238
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:03,360
If doing so works,
your family wouldn't have been murdered.

239
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:05,779
When that right is being taken away,

240
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:08,782
the weak who can't take control
want to cure his younger sister

241
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:10,492
and find the culprit?

242
00:15:11,118 --> 00:15:12,661
What a joke!

243
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:16,206
The weak don't have rights or choices.

244
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:20,002
Even if you go all out,
you'll fall into the hands of the strong.

245
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:24,006
Maybe the demons will know
the method to cure your sister.

246
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:29,470
But don't dream that the demons
will respect your will and request.

247
00:15:29,803 --> 00:15:32,389
Of course, I also won't respect you.

248
00:15:32,681 --> 00:15:33,974
This is the reality.

249
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:37,061
Why did you let her push you
to the ground just now?

250
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:39,355
Were you protecting your sister?

251
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:41,649
Why didn't you swing your ax?

252
00:15:41,857 --> 00:15:43,692
Why did you turn your back against me?

253
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:46,737
Your sister was taken
because of your failure.

254
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:50,324
I should have pierced you and your sister.

255
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:54,620
Don't cry.

256
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:56,413
Don't lose hope.

257
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:58,874
You shouldn't be doing those things now.

258
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,544
I know you can't take the blow again.

259
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:04,588
Your family was murdered.

260
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:06,340
Your sister become a man-eating demon.

261
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:07,675
Are you hurt?

262
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:09,927
Do you want to scream your heart out?

263
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:12,262
I understand.

264
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:16,392
If I arrived here half a day earlier,

265
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:19,269
maybe your family wouldn't have to die.

266
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:23,565
But I can't turn back the time.

267
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:25,651
Unleash your fury.

268
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:28,946
The powerful and pure rage
of unforgiveness

269
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:32,324
will become an unwavering force
driving your limbs.

270
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:34,827
A fragile will

271
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:38,122
won't be able to protect
and cure your sister

272
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:41,458
or avenge your family.

273
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:42,459
Stop...

274
00:16:44,753 --> 00:16:46,338
Stop it!

275
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:03,897
A simple attack driven by emotions.

276
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:05,149
How dumb.

277
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:21,081
Where's his ax?

278
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:32,593
Before running into the woods,

279
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:35,304
not only did he threw a rock,

280
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:38,474
but he also threw his ax.

281
00:17:39,808 --> 00:17:41,977
To avoid being discovered he was unarmed,

282
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:44,772
he slanted his body
so that I couldn't see his hand.

283
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:48,525
He knew he couldn't beat me.

284
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:53,238
He wanted to knock me down
when I slashed at him.

285
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:55,949
This guy...

286
00:18:00,996 --> 00:18:01,997
Damn it!

287
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:03,082
He'll be eaten!

288
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:09,046
Nezuko.

289
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:14,426
Nezuko is different.

290
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,472
She won't eat people!

291
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:25,479
Someone said the same thing back then.

292
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:27,564
He was eaten in the end.

293
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,400
In the state of hunger,

294
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:33,112
demons will eat their family members

295
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:35,864
because they have high nutrition values.

296
00:18:36,698 --> 00:18:39,451
Who knows how many times
have I seen this scene?

297
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:43,288
This girl is wounded.

298
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:46,834
She's using energy to heal herself.

299
00:18:47,417 --> 00:18:48,752
When she became a demon,

300
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:51,255
she must have consumed a lot of energy.

301
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:54,967
Without a doubt,
she's in a state of severe hunger.

302
00:18:56,343 --> 00:19:00,347
She can't wait
to eat human flesh right now.

303
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:02,766
Her protective action.

304
00:19:03,183 --> 00:19:05,060
Her intimidation towards me.

305
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:13,318
Maybe this pair of siblings
are different after all.

306
00:19:30,794 --> 00:19:33,088
I'm sorry for leaving you behind.

307
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:34,548
Tanjiro.

308
00:19:35,757 --> 00:19:37,885
I'm leaving Nezuko in your hands.

309
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:50,689
Are you awake?

310
00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:56,236
Go to the foot of Sagiri Mountain.

311
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:59,156
Find an old man called Sakonji Urokodaki.

312
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:03,410
Tell him that Giyu Tomioka sent you.

313
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:07,873
There's no sunlight now so she's fine.

314
00:20:08,498 --> 00:20:10,959
But don't bring her out in the sun.

315
00:20:28,518 --> 00:20:29,519
Let's go.

316
00:23:36,414 --> 00:23:38,416
