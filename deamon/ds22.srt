he was a Demon Slayer

with a Demon in tow,

11
00:00:29,896 --> 00:00:32,497
so I was expecting
someone with more flair.

12
00:00:32,633 --> 00:00:35,768
But it's just some
ordinary-looking kid? Too bad.

So it shall be!

Hashira 3: To think that he's
been protecting his sister,

who's now a Demon.

Do you know who you're

why don't you explain the crime
you have been accused of--

Hashira 2:
There's no need for a trial!

Shinobu: Huh?

Rengoku: Protecting a Demon
is a clear violation!

We can deal with this
on our own!

You'd really kill

Such a thought
fills my heart with sorrow.

such a pitiful creature as this.

Seeing him standing there

without any restraints
is making me feel ill.

81
00:04:08,315 --> 00:04:10,182
Based on what Kocho told US,

82
00:04:10,317 --> 00:04:12,718
he's just as guilty
of breaking the corps rules.

83
00:04:14,388 --> 00:04:17,055
How should we make him
take responsibility?

84
00:04:17,191 --> 00:04:19,458
What kind of lesson
shall we teach him?

85

What do you have to say
for yourself, Tomioka?

despite being
a Demon Slayer himself.

98

I wish to hear why

99
00:05:16,783 --> 00:05:19,251
and hear it straight
from the boy's mouth.

100
00:05:19,386 --> 00:05:20,853
What he's done is unquestionably

101
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:23,455
against
the Demon Slayer Corps rules.

why are you traveling

push yourself too much.

That Demon is my little sister!

My family was attacked
by a Demon while I was gone,

and I lost almost everyone!

Spare US these absurd ramblings.

If she's family, it's no wonder
you're defending her.

I can't trust
a single word you're spouting.

He's been possessed by a Demon.

Let US end this child's life

from this cursed existence!

I became a swordsman in hopes
of finding a cure for her!

It has been two whole years
since Nezuko became a Demon!

She's never devoured anyone

00:08:22,837 --> 00:08:24,369
Hashira 5: Well, well,

165
00:08:24,505 --> 00:08:27,373
what kind of fun
do we have brewing here?

166
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:33,112
Is that the moron who brought
a Demon along with him?

167
00:08:37,117 --> 00:08:38,250
( Tanjiro gasps )

168
00:08:38,385 --> 00:08:39,784
Hashira 5:
What the hell do you think

169
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,687
you're trying
to pull here, exactly?

170
00:08:43,524 --> 00:08:44,656
Mitsuri: Those new scars

171
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:47,792
make Shinazugawa
look even more handsome!

172
00:08:47,794 --> 00:08:50,662
Kakushi 2:
Please, master Shinazugawa!

173
00:08:50,797 --> 00:08:53,232
I must ask you
to put down that box.

174
00:08:57,337 --> 00:09:00,205
Mitsuri: Wow!
Even when she's angry,

175
00:09:00,207 --> 00:09:03,075
Shinobu still looks
as cool as ever.

176
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:07,279
Shinobu: Shinazugawa,
please don't act out of line.

177
00:09:07,414 --> 00:09:09,448
Shinazugawa: Run that
by me again, kid?

178
00:09:11,151 --> 00:09:13,552
"She can fight as a Demon Slayer
to protect humans."

179
00:09:13,687 --> 00:09:14,687
Was that it?

180
00:09:14,821 --> 00:09:17,756
You know what we call that?

181
00:09:17,758 --> 00:09:20,526
Completely impossible,
you idiot!

182
00:09:22,296 --> 00:09:23,762
( Nezuko gags )

183
00:09:23,898 --> 00:09:24,730
( Tanjiro gasps )

184
00:09:27,768 --> 00:09:31,436
Anyone who harms my sister
answers to me!

185
00:09:31,572 --> 00:09:34,239
I don't give a damn
if you're one of the Hashira!

186
00:09:34,241 --> 00:09:37,042
( Shinazugawa chuckles )

187
00:09:38,379 --> 00:09:41,113
Well, how very nice for you.

188
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:42,715
( Tanjiro yelling )

189
00:09:42,849 --> 00:09:44,182
Tomioka: Cease this!

190
00:09:44,184 --> 00:09:46,451
The master will be
arriving shortly!

191
00:09:46,587 --> 00:09:47,719
( Shinazugawa gasps )

192
00:09:47,854 --> 00:09:50,356
( Singers vocalizing )

193
00:09:52,927 --> 00:09:54,593
( Mitsuri gasps )

194
00:09:54,728 --> 00:09:55,661
( Shinazugawa gasps )

195
00:10:01,936 --> 00:10:03,468
( Groans )

196
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:04,536
( Mitsuri chuckles )

197
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:06,338
Pardon me.

198
00:10:10,611 --> 00:10:12,877
Shinazugawa: Damn you.

199
00:10:13,013 --> 00:10:16,415
Iguro: Tomioka's outburst
must have been a distraction,

200
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:19,084
but that boy
still managed to get a blow in.

201
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:21,686
If you can't tell the difference

202
00:10:21,822 --> 00:10:23,688
between good demons
and bad ones,

203
00:10:23,824 --> 00:10:26,691
then you shouldn't be a Hashira!

204
00:10:26,827 --> 00:10:29,161
Shinazugawa:
You no-good, little...

205
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:34,299
I'll destroy you!

206
00:10:34,301 --> 00:10:35,567
( Tanjiro gasping )

207
00:10:37,437 --> 00:10:40,839
Women: The master
of the mansion has returned.

208
00:10:40,975 --> 00:10:42,240
( Shinobu gasps )

209
00:10:42,376 --> 00:10:44,242
( Tanjiro gasps )

210
00:10:44,378 --> 00:10:46,211
¶

211
00:10:52,653 --> 00:10:54,453
Lord: My beloved children...

212
00:10:54,588 --> 00:10:56,388
( Tanjiro gasps )

213
00:10:58,458 --> 00:11:00,592
Lord: I thank you
for coming here this day.

214
00:11:04,264 --> 00:11:07,900
Eturned.

215
00:11:36,897 --> 00:11:38,163
Lord: Mmm.

216
00:11:40,901 --> 00:11:43,035
Good morning to you all.

217
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:45,337
The weather
is strikingly nice today.

218
00:11:47,174 --> 00:11:49,707
Perhaps with a blue sky?

219
00:11:49,843 --> 00:11:53,511
Finding ourselves here
at the semiannual gathering

220
00:11:53,513 --> 00:11:56,648
with all the same faces,
it brings me joy.

221
00:11:57,918 --> 00:12:00,386
Tanjiro: So this is the master?

222
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,054
He looks wounded.

223
00:12:02,189 --> 00:12:04,522
No, sick, maybe.

224
00:12:04,658 --> 00:12:06,191
( Gasps )

225
00:12:06,326 --> 00:12:07,993
So quick!

226
00:12:08,128 --> 00:12:10,128
I couldn't even react!

227
00:12:10,264 --> 00:12:11,597
What is he--

228
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:12,631
( gasps )

229
00:12:12,633 --> 00:12:14,533
¶

230
00:12:23,343 --> 00:12:24,476
Shinazugawa: I am pleased

231
00:12:24,612 --> 00:12:28,146
to see you in good health
as well, master.

232
00:12:28,282 --> 00:12:32,217
I fervently pray
for your continued good fortune.

233
00:12:32,352 --> 00:12:34,653
Lord: I thank you, Sanemi.

234
00:12:36,957 --> 00:12:38,424
Mitsuri: Ohh!

235
00:12:38,558 --> 00:12:41,994
I wanted to be the one
to welcome the master!

236
00:12:43,431 --> 00:12:45,030
Shinazugawa: If I may, master,

237
00:12:45,165 --> 00:12:47,433
before we start this meeting,

238
00:12:47,567 --> 00:12:48,766
would you kindly enlighten US

239
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:50,702
about this young swordsman
right here,

240
00:12:50,838 --> 00:12:54,440
who it would appear
has been accompanied by a Demon?

241
00:12:54,574 --> 00:12:58,376
Tanjiro: He didn't seem to have
any social graces before,

242
00:12:58,378 --> 00:13:00,312
but now he's
speaking so formally.

243
00:13:02,182 --> 00:13:03,581
Lord: But of course.

244
00:13:03,717 --> 00:13:07,252
I apologize for any confusion.

245
00:13:07,387 --> 00:13:11,023
Tanjiro and Nezuko
have both been sanctioned.

246
00:13:12,793 --> 00:13:16,462
I would appreciate it if you'd
all accept this condition.

247
00:13:19,533 --> 00:13:20,666
( Beads rattle )

248
00:13:20,801 --> 00:13:23,335
Gyomei: Master, even though

249
00:13:23,337 --> 00:13:25,603
it is something
you have requested,

250
00:13:25,605 --> 00:13:28,806
I cannot bring myself to do it.

251
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:31,343
Uzui: I am also opposed to this!

252
00:13:31,479 --> 00:13:35,147
A slayer traveling with a Demon
is unacceptable!

253
00:13:35,149 --> 00:13:36,548
Mitsuri: As for myself,

254
00:13:36,684 --> 00:13:39,751
I shall do whatever it is
you wish, master!

255
00:13:39,753 --> 00:13:42,821
Muichiro: I'll forget, anyway,

256
00:13:42,956 --> 00:13:45,391
so I'm fine either way.

257
00:13:51,699 --> 00:13:54,700
Iguro: I won't trust them.
Absolutely not.

258
00:13:54,835 --> 00:13:58,103
First of all, I loathe demons.

259
00:13:58,238 --> 00:14:01,039
Rengoku: Although I respect you
with all my heart, master,

260
00:14:01,175 --> 00:14:02,708
I cannot abide by this!

261
00:14:02,843 --> 00:14:05,243
I'm fully against it!

262
00:14:05,245 --> 00:14:08,514
Shinazugawa: The corps's mission
is to annihilate demons.

263
00:14:08,648 --> 00:14:11,316
I ask that you punish
kamado and Tomioka!

264
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:18,323
Lord: The letter.

265
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:19,658
Woman: Yes, sir.

266
00:14:26,133 --> 00:14:29,267
A former Hashira, Mr. Urokodaki,

267
00:14:29,269 --> 00:14:32,538
sent along to US this letter
with a request.

268
00:14:32,672 --> 00:14:35,674
I shall read to you
an abridged version.

269
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:39,411
"I ask you to allow Tanjiro

270
00:14:39,413 --> 00:14:42,480
"and his sister
to accompany each other.

271
00:14:42,482 --> 00:14:46,284
Because of her resilient
mental fortitude..."

272
00:14:46,286 --> 00:14:49,287
Urokodaki: ...Nezuko has
not lost her human reason.

273
00:14:49,423 --> 00:14:53,158
Even when starved,
she has never devoured a human,

274
00:14:53,293 --> 00:14:56,294
and that is true
more than two years later.

275
00:14:56,430 --> 00:14:58,764
Although the situation
sounds outlandish,

276
00:14:58,899 --> 00:15:01,166
it is in fact reality.

277
00:15:01,301 --> 00:15:03,301
In the event
that Nezuko does assault

278
00:15:03,437 --> 00:15:06,772
another human being,
myself, as well as...

279
00:15:06,907 --> 00:15:10,508
Woman: "...Tanjiro kamado
and Giyu Tomioka,

280
00:15:10,644 --> 00:15:12,644
will atone
by committing seppuku."

281
00:15:13,914 --> 00:15:14,680
( Tanjiro gasps )

282
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:20,686
( Crying )

283
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:32,531
Shinazugawa: Who cares how they
choose to end their lives?

284
00:15:33,934 --> 00:15:37,669
Fire, hanging,
it's all the same!

285
00:15:37,671 --> 00:15:40,405
It doesn't guarantee
our safety!

286
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:42,474
Rengoku: Shinazugawa is right!

287
00:15:42,476 --> 00:15:45,411
If she kills a human,
we can't turn back the clock.

288
00:15:45,545 --> 00:15:47,413
That person
will be lost forever!

289
00:15:49,349 --> 00:15:51,617
Lord: You do have a point.

290
00:15:51,751 --> 00:15:52,818
Shinazugawa: So, then...

291
00:15:52,953 --> 00:15:54,486
Rengoku:
What do you wish, master?

292
00:15:54,622 --> 00:15:58,690
Lord: We can't guarantee
that she won't attack humans.

293
00:15:58,692 --> 00:16:00,059
We can't prove it.

294
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:04,696
That said...

295
00:16:04,832 --> 00:16:08,700
We also cannot be certain
she will attack humans.

296
00:16:08,836 --> 00:16:10,302
( Shinazugawa gasps )

297
00:16:10,438 --> 00:16:14,105
Lord: Here is what we do know
about her for certain.

298
00:16:14,107 --> 00:16:16,775
She has been abstinent
for over two years,

299
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:18,243
and there are three people

300
00:16:18,378 --> 00:16:21,046
who would vouch for her
with their lives.

301
00:16:21,181 --> 00:16:24,516
If this evidence is rejected,
one must offer in turn

302
00:16:24,518 --> 00:16:26,685
an even more convincing
argument.

303
00:16:27,855 --> 00:16:29,788
( Shinazugawa sputters )

304
00:16:29,923 --> 00:16:32,724
Lord: Are any of you
able to do so?

305
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:33,692
( Rengoku grunts )

306
00:16:35,795 --> 00:16:37,796
Lord: Also,
there is another thing

307
00:16:37,931 --> 00:16:40,065
I'd like to relay to you,
my children.

308
00:16:41,669 --> 00:16:45,070
Tanjiro has met Kibutsuji
face to face.

309
00:16:45,205 --> 00:16:46,204
( Hashira gasp )

310
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:47,805
Uzui: That's impossible!

311
00:16:47,807 --> 00:16:50,742
Not even a Hashira
has ever crossed paths with him!

312
00:16:50,878 --> 00:16:53,411
- ( Mitsuri yelps )
- Uzui: Did you, really?

313
00:16:53,413 --> 00:16:55,947
What did he look like?
What are his powers?

314
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:57,282
Where did you see him?

315
00:16:57,417 --> 00:16:59,485
Muichiro: Did you fight?

316
00:16:59,619 --> 00:17:01,619
Shinazugawa:
What was Kibutsuji doing?!

317
00:17:01,621 --> 00:17:04,422
Did you find his stronghold?!
Answer me!

318
00:17:04,558 --> 00:17:07,092
Uzui: Shut up!
I asked him first!

319
00:17:07,227 --> 00:17:09,627
Come on. Tell US
what powers Kibutsuji has!

320
00:17:09,763 --> 00:17:12,230
( Singers vocalize )

321
00:17:12,366 --> 00:17:13,298
( Silence )

322
00:17:17,705 --> 00:17:19,104
¶

323
00:17:19,239 --> 00:17:20,706
lord: Speaking of that man,

324
00:17:20,841 --> 00:17:24,442
we know he has
sent pursuers after Tanjiro.

325
00:17:24,578 --> 00:17:27,713
While his goal may simply be
to silence Tanjiro,

326
00:17:27,848 --> 00:17:30,315
now that he has
finally revealed himself,

327
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:33,451
I wish to seize
on this opportunity.

328
00:17:33,587 --> 00:17:36,722
I also believe something
is happening to Nezuko

329
00:17:36,857 --> 00:17:39,325
that Kibutsuji never saw coming.

330
00:17:39,459 --> 00:17:40,559
( Tanjiro sighs )

331
00:17:43,263 --> 00:17:44,730
Lord: Do you agree with me now?

332
00:17:48,602 --> 00:17:51,069
Shinazugawa:
I'm afraid I don't, master.

333
00:17:51,205 --> 00:17:54,740
If it were human, there would
be no question we'd spare it,

334
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:56,408
but after all
we've gone through,

335
00:17:56,544 --> 00:17:58,744
after losing
countless of our brethren,

336
00:17:58,879 --> 00:18:01,146
asking US to house a Demon,

337
00:18:01,281 --> 00:18:03,115
it's unacceptable.

338
00:18:04,684 --> 00:18:06,151
( Lord grunts )

339
00:18:06,286 --> 00:18:07,486
( Shinazugawa grunts )

340
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:13,759
Mitsuri: Huh?
Wh-what is he doing?

341
00:18:13,894 --> 00:18:15,160
What is he doing?

342
00:18:15,295 --> 00:18:18,163
Not all over the garden!

343
00:18:18,298 --> 00:18:19,965
Shinazugawa: Hear me, master!

344
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,833
The depravity of a Demon,

345
00:18:21,835 --> 00:18:24,036
I will prove it to you,
here and now!

346
00:18:25,239 --> 00:18:26,238
Lord: Sanemi.

347
00:18:30,244 --> 00:18:31,709
Shinazugawa: Hey, Demon,

348
00:18:31,711 --> 00:18:33,511
it's time for your dinner.

349
00:18:33,513 --> 00:18:34,980
Take a bite.

350
00:18:35,115 --> 00:18:36,949
- ( Blood dripping )
- ( Tanjiro groaning )

351
00:18:42,856 --> 00:18:44,356
( Nezuko grunting )

352
00:18:46,526 --> 00:18:49,261
( Wood scraping )

353
00:18:49,396 --> 00:18:51,463
Shinazugawa:
No need to hold back.

354
00:18:51,465 --> 00:18:53,665
Just show US your true colors,

355
00:18:53,801 --> 00:18:56,134
and then I'll destroy you
right here.

356
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:58,136
Tanjiro: Get away from her!

357
00:18:58,272 --> 00:19:00,005
Iguro: It's the daytime.

358
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:02,074
No good doing this now.

359
00:19:02,209 --> 00:19:05,244
It'll only show itself
in the shadows.

360
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,414
Shinazugawa:
Master, please forgive

361
00:19:08,548 --> 00:19:11,116
the discourtesy
I am about to commit.

362
00:19:16,223 --> 00:19:18,757

363
00:19:18,892 --> 00:19:20,091
( Nezuko gasps )

364
00:19:20,093 --> 00:19:21,693
Tanjiro: Stop it!

365
00:19:21,695 --> 00:19:22,928
( Groans )

366
00:19:24,564 --> 00:19:25,763
Shinazugawa:
Come on out, Demon.

367
00:19:25,765 --> 00:19:27,098
( Nezuko grunts )

368
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,500
Shinazugawa:
It's the human blood

369
00:19:28,636 --> 00:19:30,368
you love so much!

370
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:31,503
Tanjiro: I can't breathe.

371
00:19:31,639 --> 00:19:33,038
I can't move.

372
00:19:38,512 --> 00:19:39,478
( Shinazugawa grunts )

373
00:19:42,249 --> 00:19:44,083
- ( Nezuko shuddering )
- ( Singers vocalizing )

374
00:20:05,405 --> 00:20:07,639
Tanjiro: N-Nezuko.

375
00:20:09,609 --> 00:20:11,443
