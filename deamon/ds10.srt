1
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:05,190
It's about time for you to die!

2
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:14,700
Twist!

3
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,370
Envelope!

4
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:22,370
Twisting Whirlpool-Flowing Water!

5
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,630
My sword's so heavy!

6
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:32,300
But...

7
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:34,010
Second Form...

8
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:35,130
Improved,

9
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,600
Lateral Water Wheel!

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,074

11
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:18,990
EPISODE 10:
TOGETHER FOREVER

12
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:33,130
I did it!

13
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:36,420
The Whirlpool move loses force
when it's not underwater!

14
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:39,130
But thanks to my opponent's attack,
it gained power,

15
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:41,090
and I was able to envelope the arrows!

16
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:43,430
Damn!

17
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:46,020
Curse you! Curse you! Curse you!

18
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:48,230
All I had to do
was bring back your head,

19
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:51,020
and I would've won his approval!

20
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:52,230
I'll never forgive you!

21
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,480
I'll never ever forgive you!

22
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:59,030
Shoving my face into this vile dirt!

23
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:01,780
You're going down with me!

24
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:07,040
Oh no! He's gonna get me!

25
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:12,000
I'm getting pulled by a force
stronger than the arrows he's hit me with!

26
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:14,670
I gotta unleash move after move
and go on the defensive,

27
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:16,170
or my body's going to get smashed!

28
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:18,130
Fourth Form,

29
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:19,550
Striking Tide!

30
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:27,010
The pressure is bearing down on my body,

31
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:28,930
and I can't swing my sword!

32
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:30,270
Unleash one!

33
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:32,100
Unleash a move!

34
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:33,730
Not here!

35
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:35,190
Don't let yourself get beat!

36
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:36,940
Second Form,

37
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,650
Water Wheel!

38
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,490
Waterfall Basin!

39
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:50,200
Water Surface Slash!

40
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,210
Drop Ripple Thrust-curve!

41
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:53,870
Whirlpool!

42
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:57,500
I've never made this
many consecutive moves before!

43
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:00,920
It feels like both my arms
are about to get torn off!

44
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:04,090
Nowhere near enough!

45
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,510
More...

46
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,470
Suffer more!

47
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:17,230
How many more times?

48
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:19,150
How many?

49
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,440
Don't think about it!

50
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:23,400
Just keep unleashing moves!

51
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:25,570
Keep throwing them out!

52
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,290
Not yet!

53
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,040
It's still not enough yet!

54
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:56,270
Nezuko...

55
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,480
Miss Tamayo...

56
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:59,020
Yushiro...

57
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:03,690
I've got a broken rib and leg.

58
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:11,580
N-No good!

59
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:15,160
I'm too exhausted to grip my sword!

60
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,630
I gotta get over there!

61
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,630
There's still one more demon!

62
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,800
I'll be there soon!

63
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,220
I'll be there soon!

64
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,140
So be safe, all right?

65
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:32,390
Please...

66
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,890
be safe!

67
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:46,530
Ridiculous!

68
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:50,070
It's child's play for me
to evade a linear attack like this!

69
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,160
Locating you is a breeze, as well!

70
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:57,580
The same goes for you!

71
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:00,250
No matter how well
you might conceal yourself,

72
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:02,460
I can see you clear as day!

73
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:12,810
What fun this is!

74
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:14,810
Hey you!

75
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:17,690
Don't be so rash
just because you're immortal!

76
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:23,940
Wh-What's wrong?

77
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:27,740
What do you think you're doing?
Here it comes!

78
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:37,750
Look at her.

79
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:40,290
Lady Tamayo...

80
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:53,510
You little brat!

81
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,220
You little brat!

82
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:59,020
So, now you can kick
my temari back at me?

83
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:00,940
How insolent!

84
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:22,710
You damn brat!

85
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,210
Unbelievable.

86
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:29,470
Lady Tamayo, is this...

87
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:33,090
I used a healing serum on her.
Nothing more.

88
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:35,600
Made exclusively for demons.

89
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,770
It doesn't make one physically stronger.

90
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:42,480
What we're seeing
is Nezuko's own power.

91
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,190
Without devouring human blood...

92
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,190
Solely on her own...

93
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:51,320
Nezuko is gaining strength at a rapid rate.

94
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:05,000
However, her opponent
is also formidable.

95
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:08,420
If she were to go all-out,
Nezuko wouldn't stand a chance.

96
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,050
I've got to...

97
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:13,050
do something.

98
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,680
You're an amusing little girl!

99
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:22,100
This time, I'm going all-out against you!

100
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:25,600
I wonder how long you can hold out!

101
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:31,400
Twelve Kizuki demon girl there.

102
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:34,740
You're in my way!
Step back, you damn fugitive!

103
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:37,530
Just tell me one thing please.

104
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:41,580
Are you aware of Kibutsuji's true identity?

105
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,330
What the hell did you say?

106
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:48,290
That man is nothing but a coward.

107
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,340
He lives in constant fear of something.

108
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:52,590
Stop it!

109
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,510
Damn you! Stop it!

110
00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:58,760
Do you know why it is
that demons can't band together?

111
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,560
The reason why demons
cannibalize each other?

112
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:08,400
It's to prevent other demons
from banding together and attacking him.

113
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:12,190
He manipulates demons to act this way.

114
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:14,610
Demons like you.

115
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:16,700
Shut up!

116
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:18,370
Shut up, shut up!

117
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:20,870
No way is he that petty!

118
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:23,870
Lady Tamayo...

119
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:26,080
is casting a spell.

120
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:30,540
The power he wields is mind-blowing!

121
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:32,250
There's no one stronger than him!

122
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:33,880
Not Lord Kibutsuji!

123
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,390
You've uttered that name
out loud, haven't you?

124
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:47,900
That will trigger the curse.

125
00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:52,900
Magical Aroma of Daylight.

126
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,400
It weakens its target's brain functions,

127
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:59,320
rendering that person
unable to lie or keep secrets.

128
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:03,660
It's immensely potent, Lady Tamayo!

129
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:08,170
I do feel sorry for you, but...

130
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,420
farewell.

131
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,800
Please forgive me!

132
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:16,420
Please forgive me!

133
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:20,180
I'm begging you! Please!
Please forgive me!

134
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:43,030
DEMON SLAYER:
KIMETSU NO YAIBA

135
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:47,040
DEMON SLAYER:
KIMETSU NO YAIBA

136
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:50,230
Did she just die?

137
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:52,900
She will die momentarily.

138
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:56,360
That's the curse.

139
00:11:57,230 --> 00:12:02,660
Her physical body will be destroyed
by Kibutsuji's cells still in her body.

140
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:06,780
In general,

141
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,410
battles between demons are futile.

142
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:11,410
It's pointless.

143
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:14,920
Because they can't inflict
fatal wounds on each other.

144
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:19,760
Only sunlight and the swords
of the Demon Slayers can do so.

145
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:27,720
Kibutsuji alone appears
to be able to destroy demon cells.

146
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:35,690
Don't go inhaling Lady Tamayo's spell!

147
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:37,730
It's harmful to the human body!

148
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:39,110
You got that?

149
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,740
Tanjiro...

150
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:46,120
She is not one of the Twelve Kizuki.

151
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:51,620
The Twelve Kizuki have numbers
engraved on their eyeballs,

152
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:53,370
but this demon doesn't have one.

153
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:56,130
Most likely,

154
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:58,670
the other demon isn't a member
of the Twelve Kizuki, either.

155
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,300
They're too weak.

156
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:02,920
Too weak?

157
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:04,180
At that level?

158
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:07,510
If Lady Tamayo says so,
there's no mistake.

159
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:11,770
Still, who knew
there were such stupid demons?

160
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:14,810
She physically injured Lady Tamayo.

161
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:17,100
She got exactly what she deserved.

162
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:27,070
I hope this blood will be instrumental
in developing the healing serum.

163
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:31,950
I'm going to take care of Nezuko.

164
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:36,460
Not only did I medicate her,
she also inhaled my spell inadvertently.

165
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,380
I'm so sorry.

166
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:41,960
Don't move a muscle!

167
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:43,460
You're on your own now!

168
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,760
I don't want to leave
Lady Tamayo's side!

169
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:46,970
Not for a second!

170
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:56,980
DESTROY

171
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:56,980
Ma... ri...

172
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:00,610
Mari...

173
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:03,030
Mari...

174
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,250
Here's your mari.

175
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:20,540
Play with me.

176
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:24,460
Play with me.

177
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:28,340
You're just like a little kid.

178
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:32,890
Even though you must've murdered
scores of people.

179
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,700
You were deluded into thinking
you were in the Twelve Kizuki.

180
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:56,620
Deceived... Compelled to fight...

181
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,250
And now,

182
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:01,630
you were killed by the Kibutsuji curse.

183
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,380
There's no salvation.

184
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:09,380
Even after you die,
not even your bones will remain.

185
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:15,930
Is this the price you pay
for killing others?

186
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:28,280
Kibutsuji...

187
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:33,070
This is how that man treats
even those who revere him!

188
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:35,120
He's a true...

189
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:36,450
demon!

190
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:52,720
Miss Tamayo!

191
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,100
Yushiro?

192
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:57,720
Over here! Over here!

193
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:03,350
Not that you need to come at all.

194
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:05,060
But if you want to,
then get down here.

195
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:06,860
Yushiro!

196
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:08,400
Only joking!

197
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,490
Hurry down, then, Tanjiro!

198
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:13,240
Oh, right!

199
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:22,960
Nezuko!

200
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:26,960
I moved her to this basement,

201
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:30,460
where the sunlight won't reach her,
ahead of daybreak.

202
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:33,090
Nezuko?

203
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:39,970
Why, you!

204
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:41,770
Step away from Lady Tamayo!

205
00:16:41,770 --> 00:16:43,020
That's so rude!

206
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:44,900
Stop it, Yushiro.

207
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:46,900
I don't mind at all.

208
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,400
Yes, ma'am!

209
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:50,860
You have such a kind heart,
Lady Tamayo.

210
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:52,860
You're too beautiful to believe!

211
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:57,910
Cut... that... out!

212
00:16:58,410 --> 00:17:02,540
Nezuko has been acting in this way
since she awoke.

213
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,870
Do you think she's all right?

214
00:17:05,210 --> 00:17:06,500
There's nothing to worry about.

215
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:07,790
She's fine.

216
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:13,300
She probably thinks
you're someone in our family.

217
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:14,930
Cut it out!

218
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:16,720
Family?

219
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:20,260
But I thought the spell
Nezuko is under

220
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:22,930
causes her to see humans
as her family.

221
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:25,940
And Yushiro and I are demons.

222
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:27,940
Cut it out!

223
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:31,940
But Nezuko has perceived
you two as humans.

224
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,940
That's why she tried to protect you.

225
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:41,620
At first, I didn't like the idea
of Nezuko being under a spell,

226
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,830
but since it looks like she has
a will of her own, I'm glad that—

227
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:49,210
I-I'm so sorry! Nezuko!

228
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,300
Nezuko! S-Step away from her!

229
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:53,090
It's rude, all right?

230
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,130
Thank you...

231
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:58,720
Nezuko!

232
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:00,510
Thank you!

233
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:14,940
Do you still wish to live?

234
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:20,490
Do you still wish to live
even if you're no longer human?

235
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:26,290
If this goes on, you will most likely
succumb to your illness.

236
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:28,170
However,

237
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:32,630
losing your humanity
will cause you pain and grief.

238
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:37,550
Do you still wish to live?

239
00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:49,560
Yushiro and I will leave this region.

240
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:53,440
We've gotten too close to Kibutsuji.

241
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:57,240
We must conceal our whereabouts soon
or the risk will be too great.

242
00:18:57,990 --> 00:19:00,950
Not to mention, even if I think
I've concealed my identity,

243
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:04,200
when I interact with humans as a doctor,

244
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:06,700
people sometimes
see through me as a demon.

245
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:10,290
The young and the elderly
are particularly perceptive.

246
00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:12,460
Tanjiro...

247
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:13,710
Yes?

248
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:18,840
Would you like us to take Nezuko in?

249
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:24,510
I can't give you an absolute guarantee
that she'll be safe,

250
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:28,520
but I believe it will be less dangerous
than taking her into battle.

251
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:33,770
That might be true.

252
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:38,690
She's right. It would be better
for Nezuko to be in their care.

253
00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:57,300
Miss Tamayo, thank you so much
for your concern.

254
00:19:58,420 --> 00:19:59,300
But...

255
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,680
Nezuko and I are staying together.

256
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:04,390
We're not going to live
apart from each other.

257
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,640
Never again.

258
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:12,690
Very well.

259
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:15,860
In that case, I wish you
long-lasting good fortune in battle.

260
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:17,020
All right.

261
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:20,280
We'll be leaving after we erase
all traces of ourselves.

262
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:22,910
You two get going now!

263
00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:24,370
Right!

264
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:27,830
Okay, Miss Tamayo, Yushiro,
we wish you well!

265
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:31,210
Let's go, Nezuko.

266
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:33,210
Hey!

267
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:35,880
Don't go rushing off like that!

268
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:36,960
Tanjiro!

269
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,550
Your kid sister...

270
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:44,390
is a beauty.

271
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:56,810
South-southeast! South-southeast!
South-southeast!

272
00:20:56,810 --> 00:21:00,530
Your next location is south-southeast!

273
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:01,740
I heard you!

274
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:04,610
I heard, so give me a break
and quiet down!

275
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:05,740
I'm begging you!

276
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:07,830
I got the message, so please!

277
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:09,120
Please!

278
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:13,410
Please! Please! Please!

279
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:15,080
Please marry me!

280
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:18,210
I could die any day, you know!

281
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:21,210
That's why I want you to marry me!

282
00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:24,180
So please! Please, I'm begging you!

283
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:26,340
Wh-What's up with that?

284
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:28,390
What on earth?

285
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:13,330
PREVIEW

286
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:13,330
RUSTLE RUSTLE

287
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:05,650
South-southeast! South-southeast!

288
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:08,610
I mean, I just fought!
When can I get some sleep?

289
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,570
What? I nailed it?

290
00:23:10,570 --> 00:23:12,580
Not that I was really trying to or anything.

291
00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:15,950
First, it's time for a Taisho secret!

292
00:23:16,410 --> 00:23:19,580
The Demon Slayer Corps' messengers,
the Kasugai Crows, each have a name.

293
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:23,380
I hear that mine is named
Matsuemon Tennouji.

294
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,000
Okay, one last impression.

295
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,300
"This is your first assignment
as a Demon Hunter!"

296
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:31,800
Hey! We've been fighting constantly
from the start!

297
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:34,640
Next, Episode 11, "Tsuzumi Mansion"!

298
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:37,060
This isn't really the time
for a festival, is it?

299
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:40,020
TO BE CONTINUED

299
00:23:41,305 --> 00:24:41,289
