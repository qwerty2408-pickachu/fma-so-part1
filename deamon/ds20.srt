Our family's kagura,

which has been passed down
for generations,

somehow manifested itself
into a technique

19

Did your delusion bring you

Me and my threads

were the only things
that were set ablaze.

I don't know if it relates
to your sister's power,

all the same.

Now I'm going to carve you up
without regret.

Demon Slayer 1:
It's just a runt,

it's still a threat.

Rui shared his power with US.

He is a favorite
of a certain someone,

There's no need to fear
those Demon slayers any longer.

Now, then...

those who disappoint him

00:10:22,156 --> 00:10:25,491
I can't take it any longer.

168
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:28,226
Sister: I'll pretend
I never heard that. Instead--

169
00:10:28,228 --> 00:10:30,628
Demon: I can tell
that you're not like the others.

170
00:10:30,698 --> 00:10:32,030
( Sister gasps )

171
00:10:32,099 --> 00:10:33,365
Demon: You're
much more enlightened.

172
00:10:35,369 --> 00:10:37,569
Let's run away together.

173
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:39,304
¶

174
00:10:39,373 --> 00:10:42,374
I wouldn't say this
to anyone but you.

175
00:10:42,442 --> 00:10:46,445
You're the one person I truly
think of as my younger sister.

176
00:10:52,452 --> 00:10:55,253
( Both panting )

177
00:10:55,255 --> 00:10:57,989
Demon: Tomorrow, Rui will be
summoned by that man

178
00:10:58,058 --> 00:10:59,991
and descend the mountain.

179
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:02,061
That will be
our chance to escape.

180
00:11:09,136 --> 00:11:10,502
( Gasps )

181

( Groaning )

183
00:11:38,165 --> 00:11:40,665
Rui: How disappointing.

184
00:11:40,667 --> 00:11:42,501
¶

185
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:51,777
( Birds chirping )

( Sizzling )

187
00:12:03,523 --> 00:12:06,858
Sister: They were all fools,
but I'm not like them!

188
00:12:06,927 --> 00:12:09,161
And yet, I still messed up!

189
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:15,401
Rui. Rui!

190
00:12:15,469 --> 00:12:17,535
Mother's been killed

191
00:12:17,605 --> 00:12:19,671
and our elder brother, too!

192
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:23,709
What now? The Demon slayers
aren't far behind US.

193
00:12:25,413 --> 00:12:26,678
Rui...

194
00:12:26,747 --> 00:12:30,716
Sh-shouldn't we
make a run for it?

195
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:34,753
No.

196
00:12:34,822 --> 00:12:36,688
( Screams )

197
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:39,491
- ( Sobbing )
- Rui: I've told you before.

198
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:43,561
I really hate it when your face
changes back like that.

199
00:12:43,631 --> 00:12:45,497
( Wood clatters )

200
00:12:45,565 --> 00:12:47,232
( Tanjiro gasps )

201
00:12:47,301 --> 00:12:49,567
Rui: What are you looking at?

202
00:12:49,637 --> 00:12:51,570
This isn't a play, you know.

203
00:12:54,374 --> 00:12:56,775
Sister: I only
got my face slashed.

204
00:12:56,844 --> 00:12:57,810
I got off easy.

205
00:12:59,513 --> 00:13:00,813
( Murata gasps ) A Demon!

206
00:13:04,318 --> 00:13:05,784
What the...

207
00:13:05,853 --> 00:13:07,385
( Grunts )

208
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:10,388
Sister: It's no use.
That won't work.

209
00:13:10,458 --> 00:13:14,792
My ball of yarn may feel soft,
but it's also quite durable.

210
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:16,795
- ( Oozing )
- ( Murata screams )

211
00:13:16,864 --> 00:13:18,664
Sister: First, the solvent

212
00:13:18,732 --> 00:13:21,599
will melt your clothes
down to nothing,

213
00:13:21,601 --> 00:13:23,735
and then it'll be your turn.

214
00:13:23,804 --> 00:13:27,805
After you're reduced to a pulp,
I will feed on your remains.

215
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:30,208
Shinobu: Wow! That's incredible!

216
00:13:30,277 --> 00:13:33,345
Do you release those threads
from the palms of your hands?

217
00:13:33,413 --> 00:13:34,612
( Sister gasps )

218
00:13:34,614 --> 00:13:36,748
Shinobu: Good evening.

219
00:13:36,817 --> 00:13:39,818
The moon's quite lovely tonight,
isn't it?

220
00:13:39,887 --> 00:13:41,219
( Sister gasps )

221
00:13:41,288 --> 00:13:42,554
¶

222
00:13:48,428 --> 00:13:50,195
( Sister groaning )

223
00:13:53,367 --> 00:13:55,167
Shinobu: I can see
you have no intention

224
00:13:55,235 --> 00:13:57,369
of being my friend, now, do you?

225
00:13:57,437 --> 00:13:59,304
Sister: No. Wait!

226
00:13:59,373 --> 00:14:01,373
Let me explain!

227
00:14:01,441 --> 00:14:05,177
Someone's--someone's
forcing me to do all this!

228
00:14:05,245 --> 00:14:08,046
If I don't,
I'll be torn to pieces.

229
00:14:08,048 --> 00:14:11,316
Shinobu: My,
is that really true?

230
00:14:11,385 --> 00:14:13,251
That does sound tragic.

231
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,586
I'll save you!

232
00:14:14,654 --> 00:14:16,188
So let's be friends!

233
00:14:16,256 --> 00:14:19,324
Sister: You--you're
going to save me?

234
00:14:19,393 --> 00:14:20,592
Shinobu: Of course!

235
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:22,660
But in order for US
to be friends,

236
00:14:22,662 --> 00:14:25,397
I must ask you
a few questions first.

237
00:14:25,465 --> 00:14:26,598
( Sister gasps )

238
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:28,934
Shinobu: Tell me,
my sweet child,

239
00:14:29,002 --> 00:14:31,503
how many have you
been responsible for killing?

240
00:14:32,873 --> 00:14:34,173
Sister: Five humans.

241
00:14:36,744 --> 00:14:39,945
( Gasps ) But I was ordered to.

242
00:14:40,013 --> 00:14:41,613
I didn't have a choice.

243
00:14:41,681 --> 00:14:44,883
Shinobu: Now, now.
There's no need to lie about it.

244
00:14:44,952 --> 00:14:46,552
I know the truth.

245
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:50,088
That spell you cast to turn
one of our men into a cocoon

246
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:51,957
was most impressive.

247
00:14:52,026 --> 00:14:55,026
You've eaten at least 80 humans.

248
00:14:55,095 --> 00:14:57,295
Sister: I don't know
what you're saying.

249
00:14:57,364 --> 00:14:59,631
I've only killed those five.

250
00:14:59,699 --> 00:15:01,567
Shinobu: I happened
to come to this place

251
00:15:01,635 --> 00:15:03,369
from the west, you know.

252
00:15:03,437 --> 00:15:06,037
I saw things differently.

253
00:15:06,106 --> 00:15:09,641
It was there that I witnessed
hordes of cocoons...

254
00:15:09,709 --> 00:15:12,444
Hanging from the trees.

255
00:15:12,512 --> 00:15:17,115
The human captives inside had
been liquefied, all massacred.

256
00:15:17,117 --> 00:15:22,120
In that spot alone,
I counted at least 14 cocoons,

257
00:15:22,122 --> 00:15:25,723
14 humans, all dead and gone.

258
00:15:25,725 --> 00:15:28,794
Oh, don't mistake me
for being angry.

259
00:15:28,862 --> 00:15:30,796
I'm just checking
if the death toll

260
00:15:30,864 --> 00:15:32,730
is an accurate one.

261
00:15:32,732 --> 00:15:35,133
Sister: What good does it do
for you to confirm that?

262
00:15:35,135 --> 00:15:38,870
Shinobu: So I can see
you receive the proper penalty

263
00:15:38,939 --> 00:15:40,005
and be reborn.

264
00:15:40,073 --> 00:15:41,873
- Sister: Penalty?
- Shinobu: Yes!

265
00:15:41,942 --> 00:15:44,410
That way, you and I
can become friends.

266
00:15:44,478 --> 00:15:48,013
If you go unpunished after
having taken all those lives,

267
00:15:48,081 --> 00:15:50,749
your victims
will never receive justice.

268
00:15:50,818 --> 00:15:51,950
( Sister gasps )

269
00:15:52,019 --> 00:15:53,885
Shinobu: I could
gouge out your eyeballs

270
00:15:53,954 --> 00:15:57,756
or perhaps slash your stomach
and rip out your organs.

271
00:15:57,825 --> 00:16:00,225
For every life you've taken,

272
00:16:00,294 --> 00:16:03,228
I'll exact the same amount
of pain on you,

273
00:16:03,297 --> 00:16:04,696
and after you've
suffered through

274
00:16:04,765 --> 00:16:09,367
all of the agony required,
your sins will be forgiven.

275
00:16:09,437 --> 00:16:11,970
- Let's both give it our all.
- ( Sister shuddering )

276
00:16:12,039 --> 00:16:13,639
Shinobu: Don't worry, my dear!

277
00:16:13,707 --> 00:16:15,507
You are a Demon after all,

278
00:16:15,575 --> 00:16:19,044
so none of this will kill you
or leave any lingering effects.

279
00:16:19,112 --> 00:16:21,579
Sister: Who do you think
you're kidding?!

280
00:16:21,581 --> 00:16:24,049
Die, you damn witch!

281
00:16:24,117 --> 00:16:25,984
¶

282
00:16:31,191 --> 00:16:33,826
Shinobu: I can see that we'll
never be friends after all.

283
00:16:35,129 --> 00:16:37,463
Aw, what a pity.

284
00:16:37,531 --> 00:16:39,531
( Sister gasps )

285
00:16:54,882 --> 00:16:56,014
Eh? ( Gasps )

( Gasping )

288
00:17:14,702 --> 00:17:18,970
Shinobu: Insect breathing.
Butterfly dance...

289
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:20,772
And caprice.

290
00:17:20,841 --> 00:17:22,841
( Sister gasps )

291
00:17:22,843 --> 00:17:25,611
My head, it hasn't been cut off.

292
00:17:27,247 --> 00:17:29,247
That's the sword she's using?

293
00:17:29,249 --> 00:17:33,651
I see. She's too tiny
and has no arm strength,

294
00:17:33,653 --> 00:17:35,387
so she can't behead me.

295
00:17:35,455 --> 00:17:37,523
Her life is mine.

296
00:17:37,591 --> 00:17:39,491
- ( Heart beating )
- ( Gasping )

297

¶

299
00:17:56,877 --> 00:17:59,277
Shinobu: Just because
you haven't been beheaded,

300
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:01,747
don't think
that you're safe from harm.

301
00:18:01,815 --> 00:18:05,317
There are those like me, who use
poison with their swordsmanship.

302
00:18:10,558 --> 00:18:15,627
Demon Slayer Corps,
insect Hashira, Shinobu Kocho.

303
00:18:15,695 --> 00:18:17,763
I may be the only one
among the Hashira

304
00:18:17,831 --> 00:18:20,766
who is unable
to decapitate demons,

305
00:18:20,834 --> 00:18:23,569
but creating a poison
that's lethal to them,

306
00:18:23,637 --> 00:18:25,971
that's quite impressive,
don't you think?

307
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,506
Oh! Pardon me!

308
00:18:28,576 --> 00:18:30,709
I guess you can't hear me
if you're dead.

309
00:18:32,112 --> 00:18:34,045
Silly me!

310
00:18:34,114 --> 00:18:35,581

( Coughing )

313
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:42,454
Shinobu: Are you all right, sir?

314
00:18:42,522 --> 00:18:45,123
Murata: Just barely.

315
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:46,859
What happened to the Demon?

316
00:18:48,929 --> 00:18:51,863
Shouldn't you finish it off
or something?

317
00:18:51,932 --> 00:18:54,933
Shinobu: I infected her
with Wisteria poison.

318
00:18:54,935 --> 00:18:56,268
She's already dead.

319
00:18:56,336 --> 00:18:58,536
We can leave her to rot.

320
00:18:58,606 --> 00:19:02,074
If you were curious,
I'm an expert in pharmaceutics.

321
00:19:02,142 --> 00:19:03,942
Your clothes were dissolved,

322
00:19:04,011 --> 00:19:06,678
but your body
is more or less unscathed!

323
00:19:06,746 --> 00:19:08,514
- I'm so glad!
- ( Murata whimpering )

324
00:19:11,819 --> 00:19:14,286
Shinobu: Now, then,
to find the whereabouts

325
00:19:14,354 --> 00:19:15,621
of the Demon she mentioned

326
00:19:15,689 --> 00:19:19,157
who was forcing her
to do its bidding.

327
00:19:19,226 --> 00:19:22,961
Though I wonder if Tomioka
has already finished the job.

328
00:19:22,963 --> 00:19:25,731
Tanjiro: Nezuko, I'm coming.

329
00:19:28,568 --> 00:19:31,903
Rui: I'll kill them.
I'll kill them.

330
00:19:31,972 --> 00:19:34,172
I'll kill
that brother and sister,

331
00:19:34,241 --> 00:19:36,442
no matter the cost!

332
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:42,580
Mother: What it
that is you want, Rui?

333
00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:44,550
What do you mean by "family"?

334
00:19:45,785 --> 00:19:47,319
Rui: I'm not sure.

335
00:19:47,387 --> 00:19:51,523
I have no memories
of when I was human, you see.

336
00:19:51,591 --> 00:19:56,794
Mother: Is that why you made US
pretend to be your family?

337
00:19:56,796 --> 00:19:59,597
Rui: I thought that,
if I could feel a family bond,

338
00:19:59,667 --> 00:20:01,733
my memories would come back.

339
00:20:01,801 --> 00:20:03,801
¶

340
00:20:03,803 --> 00:20:05,904
the bond of a real family.

341
00:20:12,746 --> 00:20:14,279
That's right.

342
00:20:14,348 --> 00:20:15,581
I remember.

343
00:20:19,219 --> 00:20:20,085
Tanjiro: Nezuko.

344
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:24,356
¶

345
00:20:24,424 --> 00:20:26,191
( singing in Japanese )

345
00:20:27,305 --> 00:21:27,796
