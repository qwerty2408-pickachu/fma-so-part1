00:00:07,741 --> 00:00:09,341
Shinobu: Heading into battle?

3
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:10,342
Rengoku: Hmm?

4
00:00:10,411 --> 00:00:12,477
Ah, Kocho!

5
00:00:12,479 --> 00:00:15,147
We got new intel on a Demon.

6
00:00:15,215 --> 00:00:18,083
The slayer who found it
was defeated.

7
00:00:18,152 --> 00:00:20,352
We're losing
rank and filers now.

8
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:21,486
We have to act!

9
00:00:21,555 --> 00:00:24,222
Shinobu: Could it be
a Twelve Kizuki?

10
00:00:24,291 --> 00:00:27,425
Rengoku: Most likely.
Maybe an upper rank.

11
00:00:27,494 --> 00:00:30,162
Shinobu: It sounds
like a difficult mission,

12
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:32,297
but as long
as you're going, Rengoku,

13
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:33,832
we don't have to worry.

14
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:36,368
Rengoku: And you?
What's the plan,

15
00:00:36,437 --> 00:00:38,503
taking that head-butting kid in?

16
00:00:38,572 --> 00:00:41,039
You had mentioned
recruiting more Tsuguko,

17
00:00:41,108 --> 00:00:43,241
but I doubt that's the reason.

18
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:44,709
Shinobu: You seem concerned.

19
00:00:44,779 --> 00:00:47,579
You don't think I'm going
to gobble him up, do you?

20
00:00:47,648 --> 00:00:48,747
Rengoku: Of course I don't!

21
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:51,750
( Laughing )

22
00:00:54,521 --> 00:00:56,021
Shinobu: Do be careful.

00:01:33,227 --> 00:01:35,160
Zenitsu: No!

28
00:01:35,229 --> 00:01:37,562
I can't possibly take
any more of this!

29
00:01:37,631 --> 00:01:39,964
Woman:
We go through this every day.

30
00:01:39,966 --> 00:01:42,567
Saying you're in bad shape
is an understatement.

31
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:45,370
Take your medicine this second!

32
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,372
( Zenitsu whimpers )

33
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:48,773
Woman: Good grief.

34
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:50,542
Tanjiro,
this medicine is for you.

35
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:52,644
Girl: Here you go.

36
00:01:52,713 --> 00:01:53,645
Tanjiro: Thank you very much.

37
00:01:57,518 --> 00:01:58,650
Zenitsu: Hey!

38
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:01,453
I saw that medicine
go down much easier!

39
00:02:01,522 --> 00:02:02,921
So then,
it's different from mine?

40
00:02:02,989 --> 00:02:05,924
Favoritism!
I call favoritism here!

41
00:02:05,992 --> 00:02:09,728
Tanjiro: Zenitsu, quiet down!
This is a hospital ward!

42
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:11,730
- Murata: You all seem lively.
- ( Tanjiro gasps )

43
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:13,532
( Gasps )

44
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,433
Murata!

45
00:02:15,536 --> 00:02:16,735
Murata: Hey!

46
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:18,737
( Zenitsu gags )

47
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:21,073
Tanjiro: How have
you been doing?

48
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:23,408
Murata: I came this close
to getting melted down,

49
00:02:23,477 --> 00:02:24,809
but I survived somehow.

50
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:27,812
I hear you guys got banged up
pretty good, though.

51
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:30,615
Tanjiro: Yeah, it's gonna
take time for US to bounce back.

52
00:02:30,617 --> 00:02:34,018
Murata: What was it
that happened to you, boar kid?

53
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:37,289
Hmm? Is he sleeping
or something?

54
00:02:37,357 --> 00:02:38,957
Tanjiro: He went through a lot.

55
00:02:39,025 --> 00:02:40,825
You should just let him be.

56
00:02:40,895 --> 00:02:43,295
Murata: But for him,
of all people, to be quiet...

57
00:02:43,364 --> 00:02:44,629
- Zenitsu: Tanjiro!
- Tanjiro: Eh?

58
00:02:44,631 --> 00:02:47,566
Zenitsu: Who is this?

59
00:02:47,634 --> 00:02:49,568
Tanjiro: He fought with US
on mount natagumo.

60
00:02:49,636 --> 00:02:50,835
He's a friend.

61
00:02:50,905 --> 00:02:52,837
Murata: I'm Murata.
Nice to meet you.

62
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:54,773
What happened to your arms?

63
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:56,775
Zenitsu: My limbs shrunk down,

64
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:59,377
because I was almost
turned into a spider.

65
00:02:59,446 --> 00:03:01,846
Woman: And that's why
you need to take this medicine.

66
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:04,516
Zenitsu: Agh!
But it tastes so gross!

67
00:03:04,585 --> 00:03:06,451
There's only so much gross
a person can take!

68
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,720
Woman: Don't come crying to me

69
00:03:07,788 --> 00:03:09,588
if your arms
don't go back to normal!

70
00:03:09,656 --> 00:03:12,056
Zenitsu: So cruel! That's
such a cruel thing to say!

71
00:03:12,058 --> 00:03:14,058
Woman: You don't know
how good you have it!

72
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:15,660
You realize,
if you take this medicine

73
00:03:15,729 --> 00:03:17,195
and get lots of sunlight,

74
00:03:17,264 --> 00:03:18,797
there'll be no lasting effects,
don't you?

75
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:21,333
Zenitsu: I can't do it!

76
00:03:21,402 --> 00:03:24,336
None of that changes the fact
that stuff tastes awful!

77
00:03:24,405 --> 00:03:27,406
( Murata chuckles )
Sounds like fun. Lucky you.

78
00:03:27,474 --> 00:03:29,007
Tanjiro: What do you mean?

79
00:03:29,075 --> 00:03:30,809
Murata: I was summoned
to the Hashira meeting

80
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:32,344
to give my report on everything

81
00:03:32,413 --> 00:03:35,147
that related
to the mount natagumo incident.

82
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:37,015
It felt like hell.

83
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:39,484
Those Hashira
are absolutely terrifying!

84
00:03:39,486 --> 00:03:41,954
They were all really furious
about how the quality

85
00:03:42,022 --> 00:03:45,023
of the new Demon slayers
had gone downhill,

86
00:03:45,091 --> 00:03:46,758
because there were
a number of US

87
00:03:46,827 --> 00:03:50,362
who neglected to follow orders
during what happened up there.

88
00:03:50,431 --> 00:03:53,898
They were asking me things like,
"who trained them, anyway?"

89
00:03:53,968 --> 00:03:56,635
What good was it
asking a no-rank like me

90
00:03:56,703 --> 00:03:58,570
into a meeting like that?

91
00:03:58,639 --> 00:03:59,904
( Tanjiro and Zenitsu gasp )

92
00:03:59,974 --> 00:04:03,375
Murata:
The Hashira really terrify me.

93
00:04:03,444 --> 00:04:04,777
Shinobu: Hello there.

94
00:04:04,845 --> 00:04:05,778
( Murata gasps )

95
00:04:05,846 --> 00:04:07,780
Lady--lady Kocho!

96
00:04:07,848 --> 00:04:08,981
Shinobu: Good day to you.

97
00:04:09,049 --> 00:04:10,683
Murata: You as well! Goodbye!

98
00:04:11,786 --> 00:04:12,917
Shigeru: Oh, my.

99
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,219
Leaving so soon?

100
00:04:15,656 --> 00:04:17,856
The two of you,
how are you feeling?

101
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:20,459
Tanjiro: I think
we're a lot better now.

102
00:04:20,527 --> 00:04:22,527
Shinobu:
Well, if that's the case,

103
00:04:22,529 --> 00:04:25,464
let's have you start
your rehabilitation training.

104
00:04:25,532 --> 00:04:28,266
Tanjiro:
Our "rehabilitation training"?

105
00:04:28,335 --> 00:04:29,868
Shinobu: Yes!

106
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:31,670
Inosuke: Forgive me
for being weak.

107
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:36,875
Zenitsu: Tanjiro and Inosuke
were taken away by lady Kocho,

108
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:40,679
and started something
called rehabilitation training.

109
00:04:40,747 --> 00:04:44,749
The sound Shinobu gives off
is totally unique.

110
00:04:44,751 --> 00:04:48,020
I don't think
I've heard anything like it.

111
00:04:48,088 --> 00:04:50,755
There's something about it
that's a little unnerving.

112
00:04:50,757 --> 00:04:53,291
But when she
was treating the people

113
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,829
who got turned into spiders,
she seemed ethereal.

114
00:04:56,897 --> 00:04:59,964
It's no wonder
everyone ran to her in tears.

115
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:02,634
Doesn't hurt
she's as pretty as a picture.

116
00:05:02,703 --> 00:05:05,838
I bet she could get by
on her looks alone.

117
00:05:05,906 --> 00:05:08,973
So lady Kocho
took Tanjiro and Inosuke

118
00:05:09,043 --> 00:05:10,509
to rehabilitation training

119
00:05:10,577 --> 00:05:13,645
to rebuild their strength,
which means...

120
00:05:13,714 --> 00:05:14,847
( Door slides )

121
00:05:14,915 --> 00:05:16,581
( Both groan )

122
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:18,450
Zenitsu: They're gonna
come back looking like that.

123
00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:22,721
Hey, welcome back, you two!

124
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:24,456
How did it go today?

125
00:05:24,525 --> 00:05:26,124
¶

126
00:05:26,193 --> 00:05:27,526
what's the matter?

127
00:05:27,594 --> 00:05:29,528
Did something happen?

128
00:05:29,596 --> 00:05:31,530
Tanjiro: Sorry.

129
00:05:31,598 --> 00:05:34,132
Inosuke: Don't mind US.

130
00:05:34,201 --> 00:05:35,467
Zenitsu: Please tell me!

131
00:05:35,536 --> 00:05:37,469
I'm gonna be
in the same boat as you two

132
00:05:37,538 --> 00:05:40,138
starting tomorrow!
I need to be mentally prepared!

133
00:05:40,207 --> 00:05:41,940
Please!

134
00:05:46,947 --> 00:05:49,548
Zenitsu: Scared. Scared.
I'm so scared!

135
00:05:49,616 --> 00:05:51,750
I don't wanna go!

136
00:05:51,818 --> 00:05:54,018
Woman: All right, Zenitsu,

137
00:05:54,088 --> 00:05:55,888
since you'll be
joining US starting today,

138
00:05:55,956 --> 00:05:58,757
I will explain
the training regimen again.

139
00:05:58,825 --> 00:06:00,692
- You will begin there.
- ( Girls huff )

140
00:06:00,761 --> 00:06:03,828
Woman: Those girls will get your
bedridden bodies limber again.

141
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,430
( Inosuke grunts, groaning )

142
00:06:05,432 --> 00:06:06,999
( Girl grunting )

143
00:06:09,636 --> 00:06:11,836
Woman: Next, reflex training.

144
00:06:11,838 --> 00:06:13,906
These cups
contain medicated water.

145
00:06:15,309 --> 00:06:16,975
The objective
is to throw that water

146
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:19,644
onto the other person,
but there's a twist.

147
00:06:19,646 --> 00:06:22,114
Your opponent
is able to block you

148
00:06:22,182 --> 00:06:23,716
from picking up your cup.

149
00:06:23,784 --> 00:06:25,784
¶

150
00:06:25,852 --> 00:06:26,919
- go!
- ( Tanjiro grunts )

151
00:06:26,987 --> 00:06:28,721
Woman: Again!

152
00:06:28,789 --> 00:06:29,988
- Go!
- ( Tanjiro chuckles )

153
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:31,523
( Grunts )

154
00:06:31,592 --> 00:06:32,925
Woman: That's enough!

155
00:06:32,993 --> 00:06:35,594
Last, full-body training.

156
00:06:35,662 --> 00:06:38,663
Or put simply, a game of tag.

157
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:40,599
You will face myself, Aoi,

158
00:06:40,667 --> 00:06:42,134
and then Kanao.

159
00:06:42,202 --> 00:06:44,736
( Boys sigh )

160
00:06:44,805 --> 00:06:47,539
Zenitsu: Excuse me.
May I say something?

161
00:06:47,608 --> 00:06:50,208
Aoi: Hmm? Is there
something not clear?

162
00:06:50,277 --> 00:06:52,010
Zenitsu: No, not that.

163
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:53,878
You two, come with me.

164
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,281
- Tanjiro: Huh?
- Inosuke: Don't feel like it.

165
00:06:56,283 --> 00:06:59,284
Zenitsu: I won't ask twice!
Shut up, and follow me!

166
00:06:59,286 --> 00:07:00,352
( All gasp )

167
00:07:00,421 --> 00:07:01,753
Zenitsu: Now!

168
00:07:01,822 --> 00:07:04,022
You're coming with me,
you little urchins!

169
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:05,624
- I got an earful for you!
- ( Tanjiro wails )

170
00:07:05,692 --> 00:07:07,759
Inosuke: What the hell
are you doing?

171
00:07:07,828 --> 00:07:09,762
( Zenitsu shrieks )

172
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:12,164
All right, you two,
sit up straight!

173
00:07:12,232 --> 00:07:13,966
You miserable bastards!

174
00:07:14,034 --> 00:07:15,834
Inosuke: What did you say to US?

175
00:07:15,902 --> 00:07:17,436
( Babbles )

176
00:07:17,504 --> 00:07:18,437
( Groans )

177
00:07:18,505 --> 00:07:19,738
Tanjiro: Inosuke!

178
00:07:21,842 --> 00:07:22,975
What are you thinking?!

179
00:07:23,043 --> 00:07:25,444
Apologize to Inosuke!

180
00:07:25,512 --> 00:07:27,446
( Inosuke snarling )

181
00:07:27,514 --> 00:07:30,115
Zenitsu: Huh?! Me apologize?!

182
00:07:30,184 --> 00:07:32,651
You're the ones acting
like you came back from hell

183
00:07:32,719 --> 00:07:34,586
when you were in paradise!

184
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:37,722
All you did was frolic
with girls all day,

185
00:07:37,792 --> 00:07:40,859
so why did you come back
looking all haggard like that?

186
00:07:40,927 --> 00:07:43,328
Apologize! Then drop dead!

187
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:44,929
Tanjiro: How can you
say such a thing?

188
00:07:44,931 --> 00:07:46,999
Zenitsu: Shut up,
you goody-goody, giant forehead!

189
00:07:47,067 --> 00:07:49,802
Listen to what I have to say!
( Growls )

190
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:53,271
You get to have beautiful girls
giving you massages!

191
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:55,740
You touch their hands
during that cup game!

192
00:07:55,742 --> 00:07:58,343
And when you play tag,
you can touch more than that!

193
00:07:58,345 --> 00:08:01,814
All girls have nice chests,
great butts, and strong thighs!

194
00:08:01,882 --> 00:08:03,748
They smell so nice
when they pass by,

195
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,017
and just
getting to look at them

196
00:08:05,085 --> 00:08:06,618
makes my heartbeat quicken!

197
00:08:06,687 --> 00:08:07,820
( Shrieks )

198
00:08:07,888 --> 00:08:10,755
They're heaven,
absolute, utter heaven!

199
00:08:10,825 --> 00:08:13,091
Inosuke: Knock it off!
You're not making any sense!

200
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:15,960
Isn't getting all shook up
by something smaller than you

201
00:08:15,962 --> 00:08:17,762
a real blow to your confidence?

202
00:08:17,832 --> 00:08:19,832
Zenitsu: That's right! You were
raised in the mountains,

203
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:22,300
so you've never been
close to a girl, have you?!

204
00:08:22,369 --> 00:08:25,970
No wonder you're a late bloomer!
I feel so sorry for you!

205
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,572
Inosuke: That's it!

206
00:08:27,574 --> 00:08:29,041
I've been close to girls,

207
00:08:29,109 --> 00:08:31,109
and none of them
were a match for me!

208
00:08:31,178 --> 00:08:32,577
Zenitsu: I'm not talking
about fighting!

209
00:08:32,646 --> 00:08:33,978
- Bad, bad, bad!
- ( Girls sigh )

210
00:08:34,048 --> 00:08:35,580
Zenitsu:
You'll never pick up a girl

211
00:08:35,582 --> 00:08:36,849
at this rate!
Inosuke: What do you mean?

212
00:08:36,917 --> 00:08:38,983
There's no way
they can be that heavy!

213
00:08:38,985 --> 00:08:40,985
( Tanjiro groans )

214
00:08:40,987 --> 00:08:43,188
Zenitsu: I look forward
to training with you!

215
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:45,190
- ( Laughs )
- ( Girls sigh )

216
00:08:45,259 --> 00:08:47,459
- ( Girls grunting )
- ( Zenitsu laughing )

217
00:08:51,866 --> 00:08:54,199
Keep going. This is fine.

218
00:08:54,268 --> 00:08:56,935
Inosuke: I have
underestimated him.

219
00:08:57,003 --> 00:08:59,404
I always fight back tears
from the pain,

220
00:08:59,406 --> 00:09:01,005
but he's laughing from joy.

221
00:09:01,075 --> 00:09:02,207
( Tanjiro groans )

222
00:09:02,276 --> 00:09:04,476
Aoi: I shall take you on.

223
00:09:04,545 --> 00:09:05,978
Girl 2: And go!

224
00:09:08,883 --> 00:09:10,082
Zenitsu: I would never...

225
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:12,084
Throw a drink in a girl's face.

226
00:09:12,152 --> 00:09:14,686
( Girls groans )

227
00:09:14,755 --> 00:09:16,688
( Zenitsu laughs )

228
00:09:16,757 --> 00:09:20,024
Girl 3: Now then, we will
commence the full-body training!

229
00:09:20,094 --> 00:09:22,026
( Zenitsu yelps ) I win!

230
00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:24,229
- ( Blow smacks )
- I may have won the battle,

231
00:09:24,298 --> 00:09:26,030
but I lost the war.

232
00:09:26,032 --> 00:09:28,032
- Inosuke: I wanna win, too!
- ( Tanjiro gasps )

233
00:09:28,034 --> 00:09:29,234
- Inosuke: All right!
- ( Aoi gasps )

234
00:09:29,303 --> 00:09:30,502
Inosuke: Take this!

235
00:09:30,571 --> 00:09:32,370
- Aoi: Let me down!
- ( Girls sigh )

236
00:09:32,439 --> 00:09:34,839
Tanjiro: I'm the only one
on a losing streak now.

237
00:09:34,909 --> 00:09:36,641
So embarrassing.

238
00:09:36,643 --> 00:09:38,042
- ( Splash )
- ( Both groan )

239
00:09:38,112 --> 00:09:41,780
Tanjiro: But no matter
what I do, I can't beat Kanao.

240
00:09:41,848 --> 00:09:44,449
None of US
can get to our cup first

241
00:09:44,451 --> 00:09:46,618
or block her
from using her own.

242
00:09:47,788 --> 00:09:49,722
For the next five days,

243
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:52,724
I continued to lose to her.

244
00:09:52,793 --> 00:09:54,727
- ( Inosuke growls )
- Tanjiro: So did Inosuke...

245
00:09:54,795 --> 00:09:56,929
- ( Zenitsu wails )
- Tanjiro: And Zenitsu.

246
00:09:56,997 --> 00:09:59,664
We couldn't so much
as lay a finger

247
00:09:59,733 --> 00:10:01,466
on a strand of her hair.

248
00:10:01,468 --> 00:10:04,636
Then one day,
the other two stopped coming.

249
00:10:05,872 --> 00:10:08,073
Z-Zenitsu? Inosuke?

250
00:10:09,143 --> 00:10:11,276
( Sighs )

251
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:12,578
Please train me!

252
00:10:15,215 --> 00:10:16,214
( Insects chirping )

253
00:10:16,283 --> 00:10:17,950
Thank you for a good workout.

254
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:24,756
Why can't I beat her?

255
00:10:24,825 --> 00:10:27,225
What gives her an edge over me?

256
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:29,995
First of all,
her reflexes are way faster.

257
00:10:31,432 --> 00:10:33,898
I'd probably still lose
at full strength.

258
00:10:33,968 --> 00:10:35,900
Her scent is totally different.

259
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:37,970
It's similar
to the scent of the Hashira.

260
00:10:38,038 --> 00:10:39,504
Girl 3: Tanjiro?

261
00:10:39,506 --> 00:10:41,774
Tanjiro: Also her eyes,

262
00:10:41,842 --> 00:10:43,041
her eyes are different somehow.

263
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:44,442
Girl 3: Tanjiro?

264
00:10:44,511 --> 00:10:46,110
- 'Scuse me.
- ( Tanjiro gasps )

265
00:10:46,112 --> 00:10:48,781
Girl 3: Tanjiro are--
are you all right?

266
00:10:48,849 --> 00:10:51,249
We've been calling to you
over and over.

267
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:53,251
Tanjiro: Oh! I'm sorry.

268
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,386
What is it?

269
00:10:54,454 --> 00:10:56,388
( Girls sigh )

270
00:10:56,456 --> 00:10:58,791
Girl 1: This is for you.

271
00:10:58,859 --> 00:10:59,792
( Tanjiro gasps )

272
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:01,860
Thank you! This helps!

273
00:11:01,928 --> 00:11:03,195
You're all so kind!

274
00:11:03,263 --> 00:11:04,663
( Girls sighing )

275
00:11:04,731 --> 00:11:07,599
Girl 1: Um, I wanted
to ask if you keep up

276
00:11:07,668 --> 00:11:10,669
the total concentration
breathing state all of the time.

277
00:11:10,737 --> 00:11:12,204
Tanjiro: Huh?

278
00:11:12,272 --> 00:11:14,673
Girl 1: Do you use
the total concentration

279
00:11:14,741 --> 00:11:16,475
breathing technique nonstop,

280
00:11:16,543 --> 00:11:18,410
morning, noon,
and while you're asleep?

281
00:11:18,479 --> 00:11:20,813
Tanjiro: Uh, can't say I do.

282
00:11:20,881 --> 00:11:22,881
Never thought to.

283
00:11:22,949 --> 00:11:25,283
Can someone pull that off?

284
00:11:25,352 --> 00:11:28,887
Girl 1: Yes! We're told that
being able to do such a thing

285
00:11:28,955 --> 00:11:31,490
makes all the difference
in the whole, wide world!

286
00:11:31,558 --> 00:11:33,358
Tanjiro: Even just
using that technique

287
00:11:33,427 --> 00:11:36,428
for a short period of time
really takes a toll.

288
00:11:36,497 --> 00:11:39,097
But I should do it
around the clock, huh?

289
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:42,034
Girl 2: Some people have
already been able to master it.

290
00:11:42,102 --> 00:11:45,370
Girl 3: All the Hashira
and Kanao, too!

291
00:11:45,372 --> 00:11:47,305
Girls: We hope you can do it!

292
00:11:47,374 --> 00:11:49,041
Tanjiro: Is that so?

293
00:11:49,109 --> 00:11:51,977
Thank you! I'll give it a try.

294
00:11:54,715 --> 00:11:58,017
Tanjiro: I think you should
come back to training, Inosuke.

295
00:11:59,853 --> 00:12:03,254
Feeling sorry for yourself
won't do you any good.

296
00:12:03,256 --> 00:12:05,256
You, too, Zenitsu.

297
00:12:05,326 --> 00:12:08,860
Zenitsu: Well,
those were good times for me.

298
00:12:08,929 --> 00:12:10,929
Tell them
my injury's gotten worse.

299
00:12:10,998 --> 00:12:12,397
Hey, there, Kakushi lady!

300
00:12:12,466 --> 00:12:15,066
Would you like to have
some tea with me?

301
00:12:15,136 --> 00:12:17,068
( Tanjiro groans )

302
00:12:17,138 --> 00:12:18,971
( Breathing deeply )

303
00:12:22,209 --> 00:12:25,144
Total concentration breathing...

304
00:12:25,212 --> 00:12:26,945
Morning, noon, and night.

305
00:12:27,014 --> 00:12:29,815
I said I'd try
to keep it up around the clock.

306
00:12:29,883 --> 00:12:31,350
( Deep breath )

307
00:12:31,418 --> 00:12:32,351
( Groans )

308
00:12:32,419 --> 00:12:34,019
Nope. I can't do it!

309
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:36,155
Not even close!

310
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:38,157
If I try to do it
longer than usual,

311
00:12:38,225 --> 00:12:41,092
it makes me feel
like I'm gonna die!

312
00:12:41,162 --> 00:12:42,361
It's too painful.

313
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:43,829
My lungs hurt!

314
00:12:43,897 --> 00:12:45,164
My ears are ringing so hard,

315
00:12:45,232 --> 00:12:46,832
it feels like
they're gonna burst!

316
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,299
Wait. Did they?

317
00:12:48,301 --> 00:12:49,768
( Wails )

318
00:12:49,837 --> 00:12:51,036
( Gasps )

319
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:53,905
Ugh. That was so scary!

320
00:12:53,907 --> 00:12:55,841
For a second there,
I thought my heart

321
00:12:55,909 --> 00:12:58,043
had burst out through my ears!

322
00:12:58,111 --> 00:13:01,246
I'll never be able
to do it at this rate.

323
00:13:01,314 --> 00:13:04,183
When you're in trouble,
go back to the basics!

324
00:13:04,251 --> 00:13:05,684
Get it together, me!

325
00:13:07,054 --> 00:13:09,388
( Girls sigh )

326
00:13:09,456 --> 00:13:11,390
( Tanjiro breathing deeply )

327
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:14,059
Breathing is
all about the lungs.

328
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:17,396
If I can't grasp it, that means
my lungs are too weak.

329
00:13:17,464 --> 00:13:19,130
( Singers vocalizing )

330
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,466
Work at it!
It's the only thing I can do!

331
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:23,935
That's how it's always been!

332
00:13:23,937 --> 00:13:26,205
Hard work
is the sum of daily efforts.

333
00:13:26,273 --> 00:13:29,875
It can be one step at a time.
Just move forward!

334
00:13:29,943 --> 00:13:31,076
Move!

335
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:33,144
Girl 1: Look at him go!

336
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:35,146
He's working hard, isn't he?

337
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:37,616
Girl 3: Yeah! Let's bring him
some rice balls, okay?

338
00:13:37,684 --> 00:13:40,485
Girl 3: Good idea! And also...

339
00:13:40,554 --> 00:13:43,288
Tanjiro: Blow into these gourds?

340
00:13:43,356 --> 00:13:44,489
Girl 1: Yeah, that's right!

341
00:13:44,558 --> 00:13:47,092
Lady Kocho trained miss Kanao,

342
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,493
and whenever she did,

343
00:13:48,562 --> 00:13:50,962
she had her blow
into gourds like these.

344
00:13:50,964 --> 00:13:51,930
Tanjiro: Really?

345
00:13:53,366 --> 00:13:55,300
That's a neat
training technique.

346
00:13:55,368 --> 00:13:57,168
So do you make a sound
or something?

347
00:13:57,238 --> 00:13:59,438
Girl 1: Oh, no. She blew into it

348
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:01,840
and made the gourd
go all ka-boom!

349
00:14:01,909 --> 00:14:03,842
Tanjiro: Wow!

350
00:14:03,911 --> 00:14:05,244
Ka-boom?

351
00:14:05,312 --> 00:14:08,247
Wait. This thing, explode?

352
00:14:08,315 --> 00:14:09,380
( Taps gourd )

353
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:11,116
Something this hard?

354
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:13,118
Girl 1: That's right!
Not to mention,

355
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:14,986
this is a special kind of gourd,

356
00:14:15,055 --> 00:14:17,856
so it's even harder
than normal ones.

357
00:14:17,925 --> 00:14:19,190
Tanjiro: A girl that delicate

358
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:21,860
was able to pull off
something like that?!

359
00:14:21,929 --> 00:14:23,262
Girl 1: Did I mention the gourds

360
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:26,065
get bigger and bigger
as you progress?

361
00:14:26,133 --> 00:14:29,501
The one that lady Kanao
is able to explode right now...

362
00:14:30,938 --> 00:14:32,271
Is this one right here.

363
00:14:32,339 --> 00:14:35,140
Tanjiro: It's huge!
I'll give it a shot!

364
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:38,143
Aoi: They're not
coming today, either?

365
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:39,945
Tanjiro: 'Fraid not.

366
00:14:40,013 --> 00:14:42,147
I'll bring them tomorrow.

367
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:43,148
Sorry.

368
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:44,483
Aoi: It's fine.

369
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:46,952
Don't concern yourself
with those two anymore!

370
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:49,154
Tanjiro: I'll do my best.

371
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:51,156
Here I go!

372
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:52,291
( Grunts )

373
00:14:52,359 --> 00:14:54,159
I've been running
Urokodaki's drills

374
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:56,895
while maintaining my total
concentration breathing.

375
00:14:56,964 --> 00:14:58,563
( Grunting )

376
00:14:58,632 --> 00:15:00,299
While racing around here,

377
00:15:00,367 --> 00:15:02,468
I imagine
I'm at the mountains back home.

378
00:15:05,372 --> 00:15:07,306
And instead of these obstacles,

379
00:15:07,374 --> 00:15:08,907
they're the trees
I used to avoid.

380
00:15:08,976 --> 00:15:11,110
( Growls ) Keep at it!

381
00:15:11,178 --> 00:15:14,446
Keep at it! Keep at it!

382
00:15:16,049 --> 00:15:17,649
I've regained
most of my stamina,

383
00:15:17,718 --> 00:15:20,585
and now I can run farther
than I did before,

384
00:15:20,654 --> 00:15:22,988
and my lungs
are getting stronger, too!

385
00:15:23,056 --> 00:15:25,256
- This is good.
- ( Breathing deeply )

386
00:15:25,326 --> 00:15:27,926
During the day,
I cover a lot of distance

387
00:15:27,995 --> 00:15:30,329
and put my lungs
into overdrive.

388
00:15:30,397 --> 00:15:33,132
And now I'll take
slow, deep breaths

389
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:36,301
and imagine sending that air
all the way to my fingertips.

390
00:15:37,738 --> 00:15:40,339
Meditation boosts concentration.

391
00:15:40,407 --> 00:15:42,307
Urokodaki said so himself.

392
00:15:43,811 --> 00:15:45,210
Urokodaki.

393
00:15:46,413 --> 00:15:47,612
Haganezuka: I can't believe

394
00:15:47,681 --> 00:15:50,349
you'd go
and break my sword like that!

395
00:15:50,417 --> 00:15:52,751
Tanjiro: I'm so sorry.

396
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:55,954
They're reforging
my sword for me now,

397
00:15:56,023 --> 00:15:58,623
but I still
feel terrible about it.

398
00:15:58,692 --> 00:16:02,027
Now's not the time
to be thinking about that!

399
00:16:02,095 --> 00:16:04,496
Concentrate on your breathing!

400
00:16:04,498 --> 00:16:07,166
Shinobu: Yoo-hoo! Hello!

401
00:16:07,234 --> 00:16:10,169
Yoo-hoo! Hello.

402
00:16:10,237 --> 00:16:11,170
Tanjiro: Yes?!

403
00:16:11,238 --> 00:16:13,972
Shinobu: Working hard, I see.

404
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:14,973
( Tanjiro gasps )

405
00:16:15,042 --> 00:16:16,441
Shinobu: Even though
your friends

406
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:18,510
didn't end up joining you.

407
00:16:18,512 --> 00:16:19,311
( Tanjiro shudders )

408
00:16:21,248 --> 00:16:23,382
Shinobu: Aren't you lonely
all by yourself?

409
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:25,717
Tanjiro: No way!
Once I've mastered it,

410
00:16:25,786 --> 00:16:28,319
I can teach it to them myself!

411
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:31,590
Shinobu: You have
a beautiful soul, don't you?

412
00:16:31,658 --> 00:16:33,058
Tanjiro: Uh...

413
00:16:33,126 --> 00:16:34,126
( Sighs )

414
00:16:35,662 --> 00:16:38,263
So, uh, why did you decide

415
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:40,599
to bring US all here
in the first place?

416
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:45,470
Shinobu: Nezuko's presence
is no longer considered taboo,

417
00:16:45,539 --> 00:16:48,273
and the three of you
had been terribly injured.

418
00:16:50,477 --> 00:16:53,545
Additionally, if I could,

419
00:16:53,614 --> 00:16:56,681
I'd like to entrust
a dream of mine to you.

420
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:58,283
Tanjiro: A dream?

421
00:16:58,351 --> 00:16:59,118
Shinobu: Yes.

422
00:17:00,287 --> 00:17:03,154
That we can befriend
the demons.

423
00:17:03,156 --> 00:17:05,757
I'm sure
you can accomplish that.

424
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:06,625
( Tanjiro gasps )

425
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:08,327
( Sniffs )

426
00:17:12,433 --> 00:17:14,566
Are you angry?

427
00:17:14,568 --> 00:17:15,434
( Shinobu gasps )

428
00:17:15,502 --> 00:17:16,635
Tanjiro: For some reason,

429
00:17:16,703 --> 00:17:19,038
I always pick up
a scent of anger,

430
00:17:19,106 --> 00:17:20,939
even though
you're always smiling.

431
00:17:25,178 --> 00:17:28,447
Shinobu: Yes. You are correct.

432
00:17:28,515 --> 00:17:32,051
It may be
that I'm constantly angry.

433
00:17:32,119 --> 00:17:35,421
My beloved older sister
was slaughtered by a Demon.

434
00:17:36,723 --> 00:17:38,724
I see
the mournful tears of others

435
00:17:38,792 --> 00:17:41,160
who've lost their loved ones
in the same way.

436
00:17:43,064 --> 00:17:46,331
I hear
their loud cries of despair,

437
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,666
and each time I do,

438
00:17:47,735 --> 00:17:51,670
the anguish inside me
grows larger.

439
00:17:51,739 --> 00:17:54,539
In the innermost depths
of my soul,

440
00:17:54,608 --> 00:17:58,209
there's a hatred
that I can't fight.

441
00:17:58,211 --> 00:18:01,180
I'm sure the other Hashira
feel something similar.

442
00:18:03,216 --> 00:18:05,550
But now, with their own eyes,

443
00:18:05,619 --> 00:18:08,487
they've seen a Demon
who's never devoured a human.

444
00:18:08,555 --> 00:18:11,422
They can't deny her existence.

445
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:13,558
Due to the master's wishes,

446
00:18:13,627 --> 00:18:16,462
I don't believe anyone
will raise a hand to Nezuko.

447
00:18:18,499 --> 00:18:19,631
( Tanjiro sighs )

448
00:18:19,633 --> 00:18:22,167
( Singers vocalizing )

449
00:18:22,235 --> 00:18:25,037
Shinobu: My sister was
a kindhearted person like you.

450
00:18:26,107 --> 00:18:29,174
She had sympathy for demons.

451
00:18:29,242 --> 00:18:33,512
Even when she was on the brink
of death, that didn't change.

452
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:37,182
I couldn't bring myself
to feel that way.

453
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:40,251
To do so
for something that's killed US?

454
00:18:40,253 --> 00:18:43,322
I'd never heard
of such nonsense.

455
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:47,192
But if that was
how my sister truly felt,

456
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:50,461
- then I must carry it on.
- ( Sobbing )

457
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:53,532
If there is a way not to kill
these pitiful demons,

458
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,601
I have to keep trying to find it

459
00:18:56,670 --> 00:19:00,605
while keeping the smile
my sister said she loved.

460
00:19:00,674 --> 00:19:01,707
Sister!

461
00:19:03,144 --> 00:19:05,744
No!

462
00:19:05,813 --> 00:19:07,646
Stay with me!

463
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:13,185
I have to admit
I'm rather tired.

464
00:19:14,888 --> 00:19:17,489
Demons do nothing but lie.

465
00:19:17,558 --> 00:19:21,360
They only fight to survive,
murdering US,

466
00:19:21,428 --> 00:19:24,496
and do so
without any shred of humanity.

467
00:19:24,565 --> 00:19:27,833
¶

468
00:19:27,901 --> 00:19:31,903
Tanjiro, please do all you can.

469
00:19:31,905 --> 00:19:34,073
Protect your sister
until the end.

470
00:19:35,642 --> 00:19:37,642
Knowing that you're working hard

471
00:19:37,711 --> 00:19:42,313
to carry out what I could not,
it warms my heart.

472
00:19:42,383 --> 00:19:44,249
I can rest easy now.

473
00:19:44,317 --> 00:19:46,385
( Wind blows )

474
00:19:46,453 --> 00:19:48,187
( Tanjiro sighs )

475
00:19:48,255 --> 00:19:50,789
Shinobu: You've stopped your
total concentration breathing.

476
00:19:50,858 --> 00:19:51,790
( Tanjiro gasps )

477
00:19:51,859 --> 00:19:53,325
( Shinobu giggles )

478
00:19:58,465 --> 00:19:59,331
Tanjiro: Focus.

479
00:20:00,401 --> 00:20:02,434
Total concentration breathing.

480
00:20:04,805 --> 00:20:06,805
¶

481
00:20:06,874 --> 00:20:08,874
Mother, Hanako...
