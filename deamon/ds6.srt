1
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:07,820
DESTROY

2
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:10,570
Have you gotten changed?

3
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:11,690
Yes.

EPISODE 6:
SWORDSMAN ACCOMPANYING A DEMON

6
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,020
Tanjiro...

7
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,030
Now that you're starting out
with the Demon Slayer Corps,

8
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:19,780
I'd like to explain a few things to you.

9
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,240
Right.

10
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:25,410
That Demon Slayer Corps outfit
you're wearing right now...

11
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:28,620
It's made of a special kind of fiber.

12
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:32,630
The fabric is quite breathable,
yet it repels moisture and won't burn easily.

13
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:37,630
A low-level demon's talons or fangs
couldn't even manage to tear that uniform.

14
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:40,090
It's that strong?

15
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:41,890
Also,

16
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:44,600
that Nichirin Sword of yours...

17
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:50,140
The color varies from owner to owner,
and each hue has unique properties.

18
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:56,940
But since not many people end up with
black blades, little is known about them.

19
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:00,150
So little, in fact, that—

20
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:03,700
So little is known that...
What, Mr. Urokodaki?

21
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:06,200
Since so little is known about them,

22
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:10,500
black blades are said to be wielded
by swordsmen who'll never go far.

23
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,290
I don't know how I'll do
in the Demon Slayer Corps,

24
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:19,920
but I'm going to turn Nezuko
back into a human no matter what.

25
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:22,640
Yes, you're right.

26
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:25,760
I have faith
that you're going to make that happen.

27
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:27,260
Right.

28
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:29,140
One more thing.

29
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:30,350
Take this.

30
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:34,650
It's a box for you
to carry your sister in during the day.

31
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:39,150
Built out of an extremely light wood
called "Cloud Mist Pine."

32
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:42,780
I coated it with rock lacquer
to reinforce its exterior

33
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,660
and to make it even more durable.

34
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:46,910
Thank you very much!

35
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:51,580
It's so light!
It's really light, Mr. Urokodaki!

36
00:03:58,420 --> 00:03:59,340
Nezuko!

37
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:01,260
Get inside this, will you?

38
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,220
Can you do it?

39
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:22,990
Nezuko, from now on,
we're always gonna be together, okay?

40
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,240
All right, I'll be going now.

41
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,620
Hold on. Do you mind?

42
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:06,110
Nezuko, are you all right?

43
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,580
Nezuko?

44
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:16,540
I'm just guessing here,

45
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:19,750
but it could be that Nezuko's recovering
her strength by sleeping

46
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:24,800
instead of consuming human flesh.

47
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:32,390
Nezuko...

48
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:34,770
You get lots of rest.

49
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:55,750
Could this be the town to the northwest?

50
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:22,860
Oh, look, there's Kazumi.

51
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:26,110
Poor thing. He looks so haggard.

52
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:35,160
Because he was with Satoko
when she was taken.

53
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:46,170
Night after night... It's so creepy.

54
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:48,340
It's so dreadful!

55
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,890
When night falls,
yet another young girl will be abducted!

56
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:57,350
Mr. Kazumi!

57
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,480
If you don't mind,
I'd like to hear your story.

58
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:08,150
Is that all right?

59
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:16,290
This is where Satoko vanished.

60
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:19,660
You may not believe me.

61
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,170
I do believe you!

62
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:24,420
I believe you, all right!

63
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,250
I believe you!

64
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:40,350
There's still a faint trace of demon scent,

65
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,230
but it's uneven, so to speak.

66
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:48,360
There's something strange about this.

67
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:52,490
Who is this kid anyway?

68
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,370
How dare you!

69
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:05,960
What do you mean, "vanished"?

70
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:07,500
You bastard!

71
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:08,710
Dear!

72
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,460
That's enough! Please stop!

73
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:02,270
I want you to believe me.

74
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:06,100
She really did vanish.

75
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:08,440
I believe you.

76
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:11,780
After all, that's why I'm here.

77
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,780
You're gonna keep going?

78
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:21,490
Yes.

79
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:23,910
Look how late it's gotten.

80
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:27,370
I'm flattered
that you're so concerned for me,

81
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:30,630
but shouldn't you pick up
again tomorrow and get some rest?

82
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:35,550
Those things are active during the night.

83
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:38,680
So, I can't afford to rest.

84
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:42,640
I've detected a new scent in this area.

85
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:45,810
It's gotta be somewhere nearby.

86
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:48,270
Those things...

87
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:50,360
Don't tell me you're...

88
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:51,980
You're seriously...

89
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:01,240
How terrifying.

90
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:05,160
I want you to stay indoors
for the time being.

91
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:06,910
Yes, Mother.

92
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:09,330
Now then, good night.

93
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:24,950
I wonder what became of the girls
who were taken.

94
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:27,540
I just hope they're all right.

95
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:08,700
What's gotten into you all of a sudden?

96
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,160
So fast!

97
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:13,670
The scent just got stronger!

98
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:15,540
The demon's at large!

99
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:21,630
He jumped?

100
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:23,260
He spoke of demons.

101
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:25,260
The Demon Slayer Corps...

102
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,930
He really...

103
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:39,020
This is it.

104
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:41,400
They're here right now!

105
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,870
Two different scents.

106
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:50,950
A demon and a female human!

107
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:54,870
They're nowhere to be seen.

108
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:01,090
But...

109
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:08,930
The spot where the scent is strongest...

110
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:10,510
is right here!

111
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:37,040
A morphed demon!

112
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,500
The demons who use a special spell
called the "Blood Demon Art"

113
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,010
possess supernatural abilities.

114
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:47,680
You may have to fight those demons,
as well, from now on.

115
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,600
Where are those girls you kidnapped?

116
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,310
I've got two more questions for you!

117
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,450
Who was that?

118
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:13,660
Mr. Kazumi,

119
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:16,710
Please hold this person and stand nearby.

120
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:19,790
If you're inside my range of attack,
I can protect you!

121
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,920
From the ground or this wall...

122
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:27,380
It can probably emerge from anywhere.

123
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:32,600
There's also the chance
that it could show up out of thin air.

124
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:37,730
But this demon...

125
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:41,650
Even when it's submerged,
it can't erase its scent!

126
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:46,900
Here it comes!

127
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:48,860
Water Breathing,

128
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:50,200
Fifth Form!

129
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:55,910
There's three of them!

130
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:00,580
Settle down!

131
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,330
You can do it!

132
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:04,300
Eighth Form...

133
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:07,720
Waterfall Basin!

134
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:16,970
DEMON SLAYER:
KIMETSU NO YAIBA

135
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:20,980
DEMON SLAYER:
KIMETSU NO YAIBA

136
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:25,070
Tanjiro, listen to me closely.

137
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:31,410
The type of demon with the blood
that can turn humans into demons...

138
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:34,870
There's only one in this world.

139
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:36,990
Just one...

140
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:39,540
The one who was the first
to become a demon

141
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:42,170
more than a thousand years ago.

142
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:45,880
In other words,
that is your family's foe.

143
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:47,920
Moreover, I believe he's the one...

144
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:53,470
who might know how to turn
your sister back into a human.

145
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:57,890
That demon's name is...

146
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:05,270
...Muzan Kibutsuji!

147
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:06,940
Eighth Form,

148
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:08,190
Waterfall Basin!

149
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:12,070
Too shallow!

150
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:14,950
I missed all the vulnerable spots!

151
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:17,870
Because I switched forms
midway through!

152
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,460
All three of them
have the exact same scent.

153
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:33,010
I was told that demons
don't band together as a rule.

154
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:37,680
So, one demon has dispersed
into three.

155
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:41,850
I'm going to protect these two
while slashing those three demons!

156
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:43,480
Don't lose your nerve!

157
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:45,270
Make sure you get him to tell you...

158
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:47,610
about Muzan Kibutsuji...

159
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:51,360
and how to turn a demon
back into a human!

160
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,490
Total Concentration...

161
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:57,030
Water Breathing...

162
00:16:57,530 --> 00:16:58,740
Second Form...

163
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,410
Water Wheel!

164
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:05,960
Too shallow again!

165
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:16,340
I can't chase him too far.

166
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:20,600
And I can't take a full swing
while guarding others!

167
00:17:20,850 --> 00:17:22,270
You bastard!

168
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:25,190
Back off for crying out loud!

169
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:28,360
That girl's gonna go stale on me, dammit!

170
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:32,030
That girl's already 16, okay?

171
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,940
If I don't devour her soon,

172
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:36,030
she's gonna lose flavor
by the second!

173
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:44,660
Calm down, my other self.

174
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,620
Hey, so what?

175
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
There are gonna be nights like this.

176
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:53,420
I've already fed on plenty
of 16-year-old girls in this town.

177
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:56,800
They were all quite meaty and delicious.

178
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:59,010
I'm satisfied.

179
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:02,180
Well, I'm not satisfied, my other self!

180
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:04,930
I wanna consume more!

181
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:06,940
You monster...

182
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:10,270
Return Satoko to me.
The one you abducted the night before last!

183
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:21,620
Satoko?

184
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,290
Who are you talking about?

185
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:32,550
If her hairpin
is among these collectibles,

186
00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:34,550
then I've devoured her.

187
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:19,930
I missed again!

188
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:22,090
He can escape underground so fast!

189
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:25,850
Oh no! I got too close to the wall!

190
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:45,490
Why would a mere human
be accompanying a demon?

191
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:52,830
What's the meaning of this?
Who are those two?

192
00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:57,090
Are they a swordsman
and demon working together?

193
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:06,180
I don't get it at all.

194
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:53,310
Nezuko...

195
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:01,530
This may only be cold comfort,

196
00:21:01,530 --> 00:21:04,280
but while Nezuko was asleep,

197
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:06,780
I used hypnotic suggestion on her.

198
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:08,200
Suggestion?

199
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:11,290
"All humans are your family."

200
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,040
"Protect humans."

201
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:16,540
"The demons are the enemy"!

202
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:24,630
Nezuko!

203
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:26,390
"Never forgive any demon

204
00:21:26,930 --> 00:21:28,800
who brings harm onto humans"!

205
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:23,960
PREVIEW

206
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:23,960
RUSTLE RUSTLE

207
00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:05,070
Your kicks really saved the day, Nezuko!

208
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,320
Thanks!

209
00:23:07,610 --> 00:23:09,990
It didn't break even after
all those kicks from the inside.

210
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:11,990
That box is super-strong!

211
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:17,620
But isn't it cramped in there?
Isn't it uncomfortable?

212
00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:22,250
I'll build a much bigger box for you!

213
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:26,840
Now, it's time for a Taisho secret!

214
00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:33,300
I heard today's demon has been grinding
his teeth like crazy since he was a human.

215
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:36,520
Next, Episode 7, "Muzan Kibutsuji"!

216
00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:40,020
TO BE CONTINUED

216
00:23:41,305 --> 00:24:41,289
