1
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:07,960
Fearsome monsters... Exotic creatures...

2
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,480
Vast riches... Hidden treasures...

3
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:18,530
Evil enclaves... Unexplored lands...

4
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:23,250
The word "unknown" holds magic.

5
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:27,080
And some incredible people are
drawn to that magic.

6
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:29,590
They are known...

7
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:35,010
...as Hunters!

8

9
00:01:56,420 --> 00:02:00,170
The Hunter Exam will now begin!

10
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:04,130
I am Satotz, the Phase One examiner.

11
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:08,290
You must follow me to Phase Two.

12
00:02:08,290 --> 00:02:12,560
This is the exam's First Phase.

13
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:17,570
Hope x And x Ambition

14
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:23,310
Two hours have passed since
the start of the exam.

15
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:25,330
The applicants have traveled

16
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:28,000
over thirty kilometers from the start.

17
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:31,420
None of them knows how far they must go.

18
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:35,000
They are forced to run at the leader's pace,
with no goal specified.

19
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:38,270
It's a monotonous course with no end in sight.

20
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:42,440
And many applicants have
already dropped out.

21
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:53,750
Extrapolating from historical data,
this exam type usually

22
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:56,150
involves a forty-kilometer course.

23
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:57,980
My calculations suggest that

24
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:01,160
we are nearing the goal...

25
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:13,190
I underestimated the Hunter Exam.

26
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:15,460
Every person here is a monster.

27
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:17,650
It's a gathering of monsters...

28
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:21,890
Hey! Wait up, kid!

29
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:22,590
Hmm?

30
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:25,000
You should show the
Hunter Exam some respect!

31
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,070
What do you mean?

32
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:27,890
Why are you using a skateboard?

33
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:29,430
That's cheating!

34
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:30,710
Why?

35
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:31,650
Why...

36
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:33,800
This is an endurance test!

37
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,810
No, it isn't.

38
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:35,940
Huh?

39
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:39,190
Gon, what are you saying?

40
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,450
The examiner only told us to follow him.

41
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:45,040
Whose side are you on, eh?

42
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,740
Hey, how old are you?

43
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:49,830
I'm twelve years old.

44
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:51,300
Hmm...

45
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,830
We're the same age.

46
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:53,830
Huh?

47
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,770
Guess I'll run too.

48
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:00,020
Wow!

49
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:01,550
That was cool!

50
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:03,050
I'm Killua.

51
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:04,550
I'm Gon.

52
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:07,950
Damn it...

53
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:10,430
Making a fool out of me...

54
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:17,770
Impossible.

55
00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:19,860
It's impossible!

56
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:22,080
My calculations are never wrong!

57
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:24,150
So why...

58
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:28,340
Am I... going to fail?

59
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:31,060
For me to fail...

60
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:32,020
That's absurd.

61
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:33,080
Unthinkable!

62
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,580
I won't accept that!

63
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:50,300
Hey, rookie!

64
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:54,620
You're a mess.

65
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:57,860
It's rare to see someone
out of steam so early.

66
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:01,480
You must be a hell of an incompetent.

67
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:05,530
People like you are doomed
to fail the Hunter Exam.

68
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:07,840
So don't come back, snotrag!

69
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:17,310
Here. Thanks.

70
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:18,830
Great work.

71
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:22,830
He won't recover from the abuse
we just dished out.

72
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:26,560
I doubt he'll ever take the
Hunter Exam again.

73
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,470
Anyway, Tonpa...

74
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:31,540
You really do love crushing rookies.

75
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:35,590
I live for it.

76
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:53,030
It's been about four hours since the exam began.

77
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:55,950
We must have traveled at least sixty kilometers.

78
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,130
How much farther do we need to go?

79
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:13,760
Only one rookie, every three years,
passes the Hunter Exam.

80
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:17,740
So for a normal human like me,

81
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:20,900
it isn't even worth dreaming about...

82
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,730
Damn it.

83
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:50,880
Hey, forget him.

84
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:51,890
Let's get going.

85
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:13,870
Screw that...

86
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:18,870
I'm gonna become a Hunter!

87
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:23,210
Damn it all!

88
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,310
Cool!

89
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,190
Let me try that later.

90
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:41,300
If you let me try your skateboard, okay?

91
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:54,450
We've reached the eighty-kilometer mark.

92
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:58,200
It is now time to pick up the pace a bit.

93
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:04,940
Wait, are you serious?

94
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:06,290
That guy's insane.

95
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:10,460
He's prancing up the stairs,
as if they're not even there.

96
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:12,080
If he keeps up this pace,

97
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,200
tons of people will fail.

98
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:18,970
Gon, wanna race to see who finishes first?

99
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:20,040
Sure.

100
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,130
The loser has to buy dinner.

101
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:23,600
Okay, you're on!

102
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:25,120
Ready...

103
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:25,980
Go!

104
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:34,150
Leorio, are you okay?

105
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:35,070
Sure!

106
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:36,600
Just look at me.

107
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:39,410
I realized that I can keep going

108
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:41,500
if I don't worry about how stupid I look!

109
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:47,000
I should probably follow his example.

110
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:53,380
Leorio...

111
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:54,720
I have a question.

112
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,180
What?

113
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:58,120
Is this too easy for you, Kurapika?

114
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:01,720
Talking just wastes energy!

115
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:05,730
Are you really trying to become
a Hunter for the money?

116
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:08,400
You aren't, right?

117
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,390
We've only been together for a few days,

118
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:12,140
but I know you better than that.

119
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:17,490
Sure, you have a nasty attitude,
and you aren't very bright.

120
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:22,240
But you're not a shallow person.

121
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,360
I've seen many who live for money.

122
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,330
You're nothing like them.

123
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:31,250
You and your logic...

124
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:38,010
Scarlet eyes.

125
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:42,260
That's why the Kurta were targeted.

126
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:50,150
We Kurta are known for
our unique scarlet eyes.

127
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:52,630
When our emotions are heightened,

128
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:55,980
our eyes turn scarlet, as though on fire.

129
00:09:57,910 --> 00:10:00,120
The eyes in that scarlet state

130
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:03,530
are considered one of the seven most
beautiful colors in the world.

131
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:06,520
They command high prices
on the black market.

132
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:11,300
That's why the Phantom Troupe
attacked you?

133
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:18,250
They took every single eye from
my brethren's corpses.

134
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:24,140
I can still hear their darkened eyes
crying out in anguish...

135
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:29,880
I swear I will capture the Phantom Troupe!

136
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:34,570
And I will reclaim the eyes of my clan!

137
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:37,280
That's why you want to be a Hunter?

138
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:40,880
Yeah, if I become a Hunter with rich clients,

139
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:44,540
I'll gain access to black market information.

140
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:47,380
But you'll have to swallow your pride

141
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:50,460
and become the kind of Hunter you despise!

142
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:53,060
The blow to my pride is nothing,

143
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:55,960
measured against the suffering
my clan endured.

144
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:05,930
Sorry, but I have no noble cause.

145
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:07,210
Huh?

146
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:09,760
I'm just after money.

147
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,230
Don't lie!

148
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:12,490
I'm not lying!

149
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:17,360
You really believe you can buy
everything with money?

150
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,760
You bet!

151
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:21,950
For the right price, you can buy not only
treasures, but dreams, hearts,

152
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:23,530
and even people's lives!

153
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:26,520
Take that back, Leorio!

154
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:29,120
If you're insulting the Kurta,
I won't forgive you.

155
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,670
Why? I'm telling the truth.

156
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:34,340
If I'd had money, my friend
wouldn't have died!

157
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:43,270
An illness?

158
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,890
It was a treatable disease...

159
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:08,910
The problem was that the
operation costs a fortune.

160
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:11,580
I was naïve!

161
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:12,920
I thought I could become a doctor...

162
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:16,110
I wanted to cure kids who have
the same disease,

163
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:18,420
and be able to tell them
it was free of charge!

164
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:21,250
Then I could have told his parents, too.

165
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:22,790
That was my dream...

166
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,590
What a joke.

167
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:30,230
Turns out that to become a doctor,

168
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:32,810
you need even more money!

169
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:34,330
Got it?

170
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:35,840
The world runs on money...

171
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:38,320
So I want money!

172
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,020
See you at the goal, Kurapika.

173
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:45,730
Catch you later, old timer.

174
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:47,140
I'm not old!

175
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:49,580
I'm a teenager, just like you guys!

176
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,120
Huh?

177
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,180
No way!

178
00:12:55,040 --> 00:13:05,130
Hunter Vocabulary

179
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:05,130
Killua

180
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:13,180
Can't take another step...

181
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:15,750
Th-This is it...

182
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:25,060
I'm impressed that you
can keep up with me.

183
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:25,880
Really?

184
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,910
Or maybe it's just that
everyone else is too slow.

185
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:33,200
Man...

186
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,930
The Hunter Exam is gonna be a breeze.

187
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:37,030
That's no fun.

188
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:39,670
Hey, why do you want to
become a Hunter?

189
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:41,430
Me?

190
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:43,490
I'm not really interested in
becoming a Hunter.

191
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:43,920
Huh?

192
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:47,170
I heard the exam was supposed
to be really hard,

193
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:49,340
so I thought it'd be fun.

194
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:51,430
But this is disappointing.

195
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:53,990
What about you?

196
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:57,210
Well, my dad's a Hunter.

197
00:13:57,210 --> 00:14:00,910
So I want to become a Hunter, like my dad.

198
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:02,060
Hmm...

199
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:03,680
What kind of Hunter is he?

200
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:04,890
I don't know.

201
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:08,650
That's kinda weird.

202
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:09,590
Really?

203
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:11,280
You want to be like your dad,

204
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,910
but you don't know anything about him?

205
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:17,750
I was raised by Mito-san,

206
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:20,160
so I've only seen my dad in pictures.

207
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,020
Who's Mito-san?

208
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:22,920
Aunt Mito.

209
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:24,170
Oh...

210
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:28,190
When he was twelve,
my dad took the Hunter Exam.

211
00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:31,180
He passed and became a Hunter.

212
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:32,890
Then he left the island.

213
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:36,290
I want to find out why he
chose to be a Hunter

214
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:37,940
over being with me.

215
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:42,530
The exit!

216
00:14:42,530 --> 00:14:43,810
Whew...

217
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:46,190
Finally, I can get out of this dark tunnel!

218
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:55,700
Now, let's see how many made it this far.

219
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,920
Goal!

220
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:08,190
Yay! I win.

221
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:09,320
What are you talking about?

222
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,020
I was faster...

223
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:12,120
I was.

224
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,240
No, I was!

225
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:15,930
I was faster, so you have to buy dinner!

226
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:17,000
Nope!

227
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,270
I was faster.

228
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:19,710
So you buy me dinner.

229
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:21,900
But I was faster.

230
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:24,590
Hey, who was faster?

231
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:27,210
I believe that you crossed the
finish line simultaneously.

232
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,220
Oh...

233
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:31,860
Then I'll buy you dinner.

234
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:32,420
Huh?

235
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:35,130
Then you buy me dinner!

236
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:36,410
I don't get it.

237
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:39,240
Hey, Satotz-san.

238
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,790
Is this where the Second Phase
of the exam takes place?

239
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:44,130
No, we still have quite a way to go.

240
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:45,790
Oh...

241
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:08,570
Hey, Kurapika!

242
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:11,590
Is this our destination?

243
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:13,030
No, it isn't.

244
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:14,060
I see.

245
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,350
The fog is fading.

246
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:18,080
Really?

247
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:38,810
The Numere Wetlands,

248
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:41,230
also known as Swindlers Swamp.

249
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:45,190
We must cross these wetlands to
reach Phase Two of the exam.

250
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:48,150
This place is home to many bizarre animals,

251
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:52,680
many of them being cunning, insatiable creatures

252
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:55,360
who deceive humans and prey upon them.

253
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:58,870
Be very careful.

254
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:03,790
If you let them fool you...

255
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:05,120
...you're dead.

256
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:12,480
Wait for me!

257
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,150
These wetland creatures will use

258
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:24,540
every trick in the book to fool their prey.

259
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:29,820
An ecosystem in which creatures
obtain food through deceit...

260
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:33,950
Hence the name Swindlers Swamp.

261
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:39,990
Stay very close to me so you won't be deceived.

262
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:45,190
What a joke.

263
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:48,600
How can they fool us,
when we're expecting it?

264
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:49,750
Don't let them fool you!

265
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:52,500
I just said that they can't.

266
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:57,260
D-Don't fall for it...

267
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:02,010
He's lying to you!

268
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:07,020
He's an impostor!

269
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:08,720
He isn't an examiner...

270
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,270
I'm the real examiner.

271
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:12,570
An impostor?

272
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:13,530
What's going on?

273
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:16,030
Then who is he?

274
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:19,220
Look at this...

275
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:25,410
He looks just like Satotz-san!

276
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:28,920
It's a Man-Faced Ape, one of the creatures
that dwell in the Numere Wetlands!

277
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,420
A Man-Faced Ape?

278
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:33,920
Man-Faced Apes love the taste
of fresh human flesh.

279
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:38,990
However, their limbs are long and thin,
so they're quite weak.

280
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:41,220
That's why they disguise themselves as humans.

281
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:44,600
They trick humans into following them
into these wetlands,

282
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,510
where they team up with other animals
to kill and devour them.

283
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:53,020
He intends to trap every single applicant!

284
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:56,530
Bastard...

285
00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:01,530
He certainly doesn't walk like a human...

286
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:05,580
Huh?

287
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,350
I see, I see...

288
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,810
That settles it...

289
00:19:24,810 --> 00:19:26,720
You're the real one.

290
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:35,570
What? He's the real examiner?

291
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:37,570
Huh?

292
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:42,430
Examiners are Hunters

293
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:47,080
selected by the committee to perform
this duty without pay.

294
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:51,080
Any Hunter, bearing the title we seek,

295
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:55,340
would have been able to block that attack.

296
00:19:55,870 --> 00:19:58,380
I shall take that as a compliment.

297
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:04,120
However, should you attack me again,
for any reason,

298
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,760
I will report you for turning
on an examiner.

299
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:09,360
And you will be immediately disqualified.

300
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,230
Are we clear?

301
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:11,680
Sure.

302
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:21,170
Nature really can be brutal to watch...

303
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:23,490
So he was a Man-Faced Ape, as well.

304
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:27,800
He was attempting to confuse
the applicants,

305
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:30,000
to lure some of them away.

306
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:33,100
We cannot relax our guard.

307
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:33,870
Yeah.

308
00:20:34,290 --> 00:20:38,880
You will be encountering such
deception on a regular basis.

309
00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:43,280
I believe that a number of you

310
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,890
were fooled into suspecting my identity?

311
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:51,750
Do you understand?

312
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:57,860
If you lose sight of me in
the Numere Wetlands fog,

313
00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:02,140
you will never reach the exam's Second Phase.

314
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:03,150
Do bear that in mind.

315
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,000
Then let us be on our way.

316
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,160
Please follow me.

317
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:31,530
Tsk, another marathon.

318
00:21:31,530 --> 00:21:33,870
And we're running through marsh this time.

319
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:36,850
Running on wet ground requires more energy.

320
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:42,610
The applicants have finally escaped
the long, dark tunnel.

321
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:46,520
Thus far, 36 candidates have
withdrawn from the exam,

322
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:49,380
leaving 368 remaining applicants.

323
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:52,680
Their next challenge is the Numere Wetlands,

324
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:55,660
also known as Swindlers Swamp.

325
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:59,710
The brutal Hunter Exam continues.

326
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:32,390
Next time: Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!

327
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,040
Okey-dokey!

327
00:23:35,305 --> 00:24:35,851
