1
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:07,960
Fearsome monsters... Exotic creatures...

2
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,480
Vast riches... Hidden treasures...

3
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:18,530
Evil enclaves... Unexplored lands...

4
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:23,250
The word "unknown" holds magic.

5
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:27,080
And some incredible people are
drawn to that magic.

6
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:29,590
They are known...

7
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,010
...as Hunters!

00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:04,210
I see, I see...

10
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:06,540
That settles it...

11
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,560
You're the real one.

12
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:14,090
Examiners are Hunters

13
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:18,900
selected by the committee to perform
this duty without pay.

14
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:22,910
Any Hunter, bearing the title we seek,

15
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:27,160
would have been able to block that attack.

16
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:30,000
I shall take that as a compliment.

17
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:35,690
However, should you attack me again,
for any reason,

18
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:38,210
I will report you for turning
on an examiner.

19
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:40,730
And you will be immediately disqualified.

20
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:42,050
Are we clear?

21
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:43,510
Sure.

22
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:49,810
Hisoka x Is x Sneaky

23
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:57,800
The 368 applicants who made it through
the long underground tunnel

24
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:01,220
find themselves in an unexplored land
teeming with strange creatures,

25
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:04,550
known as the Numere Wetlands.

26
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,440
Pay attention now.

27
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:17,840
Be sure to stay close behind me.

28
00:03:57,890 --> 00:04:00,260
The fog is getting thicker.

29
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,210
All right...

30
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:07,360
This is our chance.

31
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:11,220
We'll take advantage of the fog
to get rid of him!

32
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:19,530
Gon...

33
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:20,700
Huh?

34
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:22,410
Let's move up.

35
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:23,450
Okay.

36
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:26,500
We don't want to lose sight
of the examiner.

37
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,870
I'm more concerned with

38
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:29,790
increasing the distance between
us and Hisoka.

39
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:32,660
Staying too close to him is dangerous.

40
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,950
I can smell it in the air.

41
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,380
Smell?

42
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,430
Hmm...

43
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:42,420
I don't think he smells.

44
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:45,150
Leorio! Kurapika!

45
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:48,520
Killua says that we should move up!

46
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,350
Hey...

47
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:51,680
Can't you feel the tension
surrounding us?

48
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,170
Moron!

49
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:55,810
If I had the strength,
I'd already be there!

50
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:57,560
Don't worry about us!

51
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:59,570
What?

52
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:01,260
Let's go, Gon.

53
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:03,430
Ah, wait!

54
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:14,810
We can't even tell
which way we're going.

55
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:15,710
It's okay.

56
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:19,340
As long as we don't lose sight
of the guys ahead of us...

57
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:27,840
What's going on?

58
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:34,980
Wh-What?

59
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,360
Noggin Luggin' Tortoise

60
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:57,510
This looks bad...

61
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:24,730
Claymore Mushrooms

62
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:35,620
Huh? What?

63
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:37,660
A butterfly?

64
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,890
Hypnosis Butterfly

65
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,450
Damn!

66
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:04,480
Which way are we supposed to go?

67
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,370
Did we lose sight of him?

68
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:08,900
Pay attention now.

69
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:13,530
Be sure to stay close behind me.

70
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:14,910
Over there!

71
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:32,620
Pay attention now.

72
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:34,430
Caw!

73
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:38,780
Be sure to stay close behind me.

74
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:40,060
Ruse Raven

75
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:40,060
Caw!

76
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:43,330
That thing can imitate human speech?

77
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:44,930
Close call...

78
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:46,320
Yeah...

79
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:52,320
I hear people screaming all around us.

80
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,790
Just stay on your guard.

81
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:57,830
I wonder if Leorio and
Kurapika are okay...

82
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:00,800
Mm?

83
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:12,340
Frog-in-Waiting

84
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:25,650
Leorio!

85
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:48,850
Ouch.

86
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:51,550
Leorio, here's our opportunity.

87
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:53,300
Y-Yeah...

88
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:19,000
Guess he didn't like the taste of us.

89
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,080
It was this.

90
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,700
That was from Tonpa-san!

91
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:25,020
Guess he saved us.

92
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:28,350
Well, I could have escaped.

93
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,670
I'm still worried about Leorio and Kurapika.

94
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:36,130
Forget about them. Let's get a move on.

95
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:38,220
We can still catch up to the examiner.

96
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,310
We've lost sight of the front-runners.

97
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:52,980
Which way should we go?

98
00:09:57,990 --> 00:09:58,990
Stop!

99
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:01,150
Over there...

100
00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:12,130
When I saw you last year,

101
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:15,390
I knew you weren't Hunter material.

102
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:19,010
We'll spare you if you swear not to
take the Hunter Exam again.

103
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:20,840
Sure.

104
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:21,690
Huh?

105
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:23,170
I'm passing the exam this year,

106
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:24,630
so I won't need to retake it.

107
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:25,690
Passing?

108
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:26,650
Idiot!

109
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:28,220
Look at this fog.

110
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:32,250
It's impossible to determine which
direction the main pack went!

111
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:36,650
Meaning we've all failed the exam!

112
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:40,170
So that's why.

113
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:43,030
Having already failed, you wish
to play examiner.

114
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:45,700
Hunters require prey.

115
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,910
Why don't I play examiner...

116
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:53,050
And judge whether you
are Hunter material?

117
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:58,800
Shut up!

118
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:29,080
Now, then...

119
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:39,520
H-H-Help!

120
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:41,260
Hel—

121
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:56,730
Well?

122
00:11:58,290 --> 00:12:00,070
Care to participate,

123
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:03,070
in my little game of examiner?

124
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:18,170
Hunter Vocabulary

125
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,170
Satotz

126
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:31,090
Cool...

127
00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:33,810
We've caught up to the
main group, Gon.

128
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:36,400
Huh?

129
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,550
Where'd he go?

130
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:56,170
Leorio.

131
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:59,380
On my signal, we run in
opposite directions.

132
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:00,440
What?

133
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:05,620
He is vastly more experienced
in real combat.

134
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:09,100
The two of us won't stand a
chance against him.

135
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:13,740
We cannot afford to squander time
in a pointless fight!

136
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:40,250
Now!

137
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:52,160
I see...

138
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,350
A wise decision.

139
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:04,280
Hmm?

140
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:13,290
I just can't do it...

141
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:18,300
This may not be my fight,

142
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:22,180
but I won't close my eyes

143
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:26,920
and make a break for it!

144
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:28,680
Leorio?!

145
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:35,680
Mm, I adore that look on your face.

146
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:42,730
What?

147
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:09,800
Gon?

148
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,420
I made it in time...

149
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:17,770
Not bad, little boy.

150
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,610
Is that a fishing pole?

151
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:23,720
What a fascinating weapon.

152
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:33,030
Allow me a closer look.

153
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:37,660
Your fight is with

154
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:40,250
me!

155
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:53,550
You came to rescue your friend?

156
00:15:56,010 --> 00:15:57,770
Such a good boy.

157
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,390
And that expression...

158
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:09,880
Nice...

159
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,320
Very nice.

160
00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:15,400
I'm getting excited now...

161
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:18,410
Okay!

162
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,860
How wonderful...

163
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:58,990
I really do love that look.

164
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,110
Do not fear.

165
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:13,420
I will not kill your friend.

166
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:16,930
He passed.

167
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:24,220
Yes, you pass, as well.

168
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:26,690
Grow up and become a fine Hunter.

169
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,970
Hisoka, you should get back here.

170
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:37,450
We're nearly at the Phase Two site.

171
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:39,660
Okay, I'll be right there.

172
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:45,010
It's always good to have friends.

173
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,960
You can find your own way back, yes?

174
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,880
That's a good boy.

175
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:14,320
Gon!

176
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:16,260
Are you all right?

177
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:34,600
Huh?

178
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:37,480
Gon isn't here...

179
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,650
This way.

180
00:18:58,610 --> 00:19:01,010
You can really tell?

181
00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:02,160
Uh-huh.

182
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:05,610
Leorio's cologne is very unique.

183
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:08,580
I can smell him from a
few kilometers away.

184
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:17,710
Say, Kurapika...

185
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:21,720
What did Hisoka mean when
he said that we passed?

186
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:26,820
Hisoka was acting as a judge.

187
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:28,120
A judge?

188
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,060
Yes.

189
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:34,100
He must have his own benchmarks
for evaluating power.

190
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:37,400
It's possible that he was ascertaining
each applicant's strength.

191
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:43,230
Apparently, you and Leorio must
have met his standards.

192
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:45,520
I see.

193
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:49,160
But I was powerless to do
anything against him.

194
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:52,370
Didn't you land your first hit on him?

195
00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:54,540
Only because I surprised him.

196
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:59,130
Besides, Leorio passed,
even though he lost...

197
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:01,370
Hmm...

198
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:05,640
Perhaps he sensed that you
were kindred spirits.

199
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:07,390
Kindred spirits?

200
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:13,060
I seriously doubt that Hisoka
could qualify as a Hunter.

201
00:20:13,810 --> 00:20:15,110
However,

202
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:17,730
I must admit that he did impress me

203
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:22,110
with his superhuman agility
and graceful technique.

204
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:25,160
It's quite common that those

205
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:28,770
possessing special talents are drawn
to others with unique gifts.

206
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:32,100
Most likely, Hisoka's instincts
and experience

207
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:36,590
told him that you had the skill and
potential to become Hunters.

208
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:41,590
Killing you now would have been a waste...

209
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:44,130
That was his perspective.

210
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:48,090
Oh, I'm sorry!

211
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:49,970
Was that insensitive on my part?

212
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:51,390
No...

213
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:55,060
But I was pretty excited, as well.

214
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:59,490
I was so scared, I wanted to run away.

215
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:01,320
But I couldn't.

216
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:03,900
And at the same time, I was excited.

217
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:05,320
Isn't that strange?

218
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:33,310
For the first time in his life,
Gon has experienced mortal fear.

219
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:38,710
Though the unfamiliar feelings
accompanying that fear confuse Gon,

220
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:43,820
he cannot restrain his growing curiosity.

221
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:51,420
At this stage, 220 candidates have
withdrawn from the exam,

222
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:54,580
leaving 148 remaining applicants.

223
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:29,960
Next time: A x Surprising x Challenge!

224
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:32,120
S-Surprisingly challenging.

225
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:32,850
Huh?

226
00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:34,300
Gon, are you okay?

226
00:23:35,305 --> 00:24:35,851
