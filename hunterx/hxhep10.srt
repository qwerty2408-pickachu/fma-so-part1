1
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:07,960
Fearsome monsters... Exotic creatures...

2
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,110
Vast riches... Hidden treasures...

3
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:18,280
Evil enclaves... Unexplored lands...

4
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:23,250
The word "unknown" holds magic.

5
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:27,080
And some incredible people are
drawn to that magic.

6
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:29,590
They are known...

7
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:35,010
...as Hunters!

00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:57,570
Consider this a warning...

10
00:01:57,570 --> 00:01:58,590
First,

11
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:03,560
a real Phantom Troupe tattoo has the
member's number on the spider.

12
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:05,580
Second,

13
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:10,310
they don't bother counting
how many they've killed.

14
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:12,890
Third,

15
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:15,950
never mention the Troupe again.

16
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,010
If you do,

17
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,830
I'll kill you.

18
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:27,830
Trick x To The x Trick

19
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:33,980
Leorio has volunteered for
the fourth round.

20
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:37,340
If he wins, the group's victory is assured.

21
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:41,070
But can he win?

22
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:51,950
Okay!

23
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:53,440
I'll finish up the job.

24
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:57,190
Toss that guy out, and send in
your next competitor!

25
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:02,950
We can't do that.

26
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:04,450
What's that?

27
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:07,520
We can't move him yet,

28
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,720
because his match hasn't been settled.

29
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:12,710
The match hasn't been settled?

30
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:15,210
What do you mean?

31
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:22,280
He's still alive.

32
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,590
He was only knocked out.

33
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:27,610
Did you forget?

34
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:29,250
This was a death match.

35
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:33,750
The fight doesn't end until one
contestant surrenders or dies.

36
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:38,520
He's still alive, and he
hasn't surrendered.

37
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:45,080
Tsk... Damned technicalities!

38
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:47,750
But she's right.

39
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:49,070
I agree.

40
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:51,250
I see...

41
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:53,290
Hey, Kurapika!

42
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:56,250
Go finish off that worthless trash.

43
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:58,250
I refuse.

44
00:03:58,250 --> 00:03:59,240
Huh?

45
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:01,450
Why?!

46
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,010
The fight is over.

47
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:09,680
He'd already lost his will to fight

48
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:12,330
when I punched him.

49
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:18,770
I will not fight someone who's lost.

50
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:20,220
Screw that!

51
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:21,600
Then what do we do?

52
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,780
They're claiming that the
match hasn't ended!

53
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,860
Let him handle it.

54
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:27,790
Huh?!

55
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:32,290
Once he wakes up,
we'll have our answer.

56
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:33,770
Hey, now...

57
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:36,680
We only have so much time left.

58
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,700
We can't afford to just sit and wait!

59
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:40,790
I have no intention of killing him!

60
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:42,540
Come on!

61
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:43,300
Hey...

62
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:46,300
If you don't want to dirty
your hands, I'll do it.

63
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,430
Killua?

64
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:50,510
You haven't ever killed
anyone before, right?

65
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,060
Are you scared?

66
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:58,810
I have never considered whether
murder is frightening.

67
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:02,570
But this is a one-on-one battle.

68
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:04,320
You aren't permitted to interfere.

69
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,380
Okay, then...

70
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:10,420
But we're working as a team,

71
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:11,950
so you shouldn't be too selfish.

72
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:12,670
Oh!

73
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:14,530
You do say useful things sometimes!

74
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:15,860
Keep it up!

75
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:18,330
Don't you understand that you're
screwing up our chances?

76
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:21,560
I'm sorry, but I won't change my mind.

77
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:24,340
You stubborn fool...

78
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:25,970
Fine!

79
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:27,590
A majority decision...

80
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:29,850
O to kill him,

81
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:32,100
and X to leave him alive.

82
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,100
Ready, and...

83
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:40,810
Why isn't it working?!

84
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:43,990
Maybe it's because we're
asking the question?

85
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:45,570
Huh?

86
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:49,630
The watches only work for questions
presented by the examiners.

87
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:52,290
I see...

88
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:53,330
Okay!

89
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:55,860
Then we'll use a show of hands!

90
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:58,580
Those who agree that he
should be finished off...

91
00:05:58,580 --> 00:05:59,940
Now!

92
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:08,610
You traitor...

93
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:11,650
Weren't you just lecturing
Kurapika with me?

94
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:14,800
We're supposed to be a team...
A team!

95
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,200
But it's pointless!

96
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,850
He's not gonna change his mind.

97
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:18,920
Hey, Gon!

98
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,960
Why do you oppose killing him?

99
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,940
Kurapika's right.

100
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:26,360
He was on the verge of surrendering.

101
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,860
Let's wait for him to wake up.

102
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:33,070
We don't know how long
that will take.

103
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:35,620
I should just...

104
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:38,000
You shouldn't force others to do things.

105
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,120
Different people have different
circumstances and ideals.

106
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,750
No one asked your opinion.

107
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:44,880
Hey...

108
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,140
A majority ruling implies that you're
asking everyone's opinion.

109
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:51,420
Damn it! Fine!

110
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:53,200
Do whatever you want!

111
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,770
Leorio...

112
00:06:57,030 --> 00:06:59,020
Man, what's wrong with these people?

113
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:01,270
Now he's sulking.

114
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:04,100
None of this matters if we can't even progress.

115
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:06,050
Don't you people get it?

116
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:08,660
Just leave him alone.

117
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:11,530
Fools...

118
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:15,530
They've fallen for the trap
of the majority decision.

119
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:20,640
You would expect it to be easier
for five people who've just met

120
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:24,290
to make decisions by majority rule.

121
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:28,460
While this method appears to
revere each individual opinion,

122
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:32,300
in actuality, it suppresses the minority.

123
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:36,000
When a person consistently finds himself
in the minority,

124
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,710
his opinion is always rejected.

125
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:39,980
His alienation,

126
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:43,990
anger, and discontent lead to antagonism.

127
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:46,320
Eventually, the team dissolves.

128
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:51,280
After all, we're rivals in
this Hunter Exam.

129
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,880
None of us would just
stand by and watch,

130
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,780
as our chances were hurt

131
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:59,930
by someone else's dumb mistakes.

132
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:02,750
But having been caught up in
the spirit of this test,

133
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:07,200
he's begun using majority decision
in unrelated situations.

134
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,220
And he made the mistake of holding

135
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:12,680
a discussion before the vote.

136
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:17,680
He even used majority decision in its
worst form, a public show of hands.

137
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:22,160
Unlike when people press the buttons
of their own watches,

138
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:26,390
everyone knows who diverged
from the majority.

139
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:28,940
So the minority can't even
protest the decision.

140
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:33,660
When someone feels they have no say,

141
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:37,900
and that their opinions are
constantly rejected,

142
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:40,030
the group breaks down.

143
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:41,360
In this case,

144
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,210
it means all five of us will fail the exam.

145
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,840
It's just a matter of time.

146
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:55,470
The atmosphere on the
other side is gloomy.

147
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,540
I've been waiting for you...

148
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:28,630
...Hisoka.

149
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,890
I'm not an examiner this year.

150
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:32,510
I'm here for revenge.

151
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:34,680
Since last year's exam,

152
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:37,250
all I've focused on was killing you.

153
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:42,350
Today, I'll get payback

154
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:44,530
for my scars!

155
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:47,010
Hmph.

156
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:51,110
Those scars merely show that you
were an incompetent examiner.

157
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:53,860
You're blaming me for your
own inadequacies.

158
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:55,470
Keep yapping!

159
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,860
Prepare to die.

160
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,210
Dual wielding?

161
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:07,790
Infinite quad wielding!

162
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,210
Take this...

163
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:29,020
It's not over yet!

164
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:36,590
Up, down, left, right.

165
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:37,690
Front and back...

166
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:39,150
You have nowhere to run!

167
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:43,160
You'll be cut from every angle,
by my endless stream of blades.

168
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:46,010
Dodging my infinite attack waves
is impossible!

169
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:49,000
I'll have you writhe in pain...

170
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:55,130
...until you die, Hisoka!

171
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:05,480
It would indeed be difficult
to dodge your attacks.

172
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:10,100
Thus, I should simply stop the blades.

173
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:11,780
Impossible...

174
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:15,860
It took me over half a year
to master catching those blades!

175
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:21,530
Oh...

176
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,330
It was easier than anticipated.

177
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,580
I appreciate your futile efforts.

178
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,450
Damn it!

179
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:49,140
Hunter Vocabulary

180
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:49,140
Hisoka

181
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:06,660
Hisoka, applicant #44, is the first
to pass the Third Phase.

182
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:10,750
Total time, six hours and
seventeen minutes.

183
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:19,830
Tsk...

184
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:41,310
Is something wrong, Gon?

185
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:42,310
Uh-huh.

186
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:50,700
I get it...

187
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:53,730
Hey...

188
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:57,080
It's quite possible that
he's already dead.

189
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:01,490
What's that?

190
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:03,470
Well, it's been several hours,

191
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:05,410
and he hasn't moved an inch.

192
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:12,950
Damn...

193
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:15,490
It's too far away for us to tell.

194
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:20,860
Hey! We want to check his body!

195
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:23,360
What's that?

196
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:27,360
He could already be dead.

197
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:31,370
I already told you,
he's only unconscious.

198
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:34,460
How many hours has it been?

199
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:37,200
I can't just take your word for it!

200
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,110
Then let's make a bet.

201
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:42,250
A bet?

202
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,380
On what?

203
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:48,120
On whether he's dead or alive.

204
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:52,260
What would we wager?

205
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,190
Time.

206
00:13:56,950 --> 00:13:57,810
Time?

207
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:04,000
We will settle our match through
a betting game, a gamble.

208
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,030
And we'll use time, rather than chips.

209
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:10,740
Look at the monitor on the wall.

210
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:15,240
We each have fifty hours.

211
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:18,610
However, we can only wager
multiples of ten.

212
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:23,250
We continue placing bets until one
of us has no hours left.

213
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:27,220
A match where we gamble time...

214
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:30,580
We'll take turns deciding
what to bet on.

215
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,750
If you end up with zero hours,

216
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:36,740
your time limit will also be
shortened by fifty hours.

217
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:40,230
And if you end up with zero hours?

218
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:43,730
Our sentences will be
extended by fifty years.

219
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:46,730
If these terms are acceptable,

220
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:49,240
I'll check whether he's still alive.

221
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:54,790
Leroute...

222
00:14:55,210 --> 00:14:57,460
Serving a 112-year sentence

223
00:14:57,460 --> 00:15:01,290
for endangered species trafficking
and illegal gambling.

224
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:04,950
This match sounds like
her kind of game.

225
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,730
Man, this chick is whack.

226
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,700
She's willing to risk extending
her own sentence.

227
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:15,180
Consider your answer carefully, Leorio.

228
00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:18,970
If you lose, we'll have
fifty fewer hours

229
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:20,690
with which to escape the tower.

230
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:23,130
You shouldn't talk...

231
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:27,100
After all, this is your fault,
for not finishing him off!

232
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:29,150
Fine!

233
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:31,350
I won't say another word!

234
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:35,090
Hey, we shouldn't fight
amongst ourselves!

235
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:39,720
Keep fighting, keep fighting...

236
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:41,710
Right!

237
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:43,560
I accept!

238
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:48,000
Okay! I chose our first bet,

239
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,490
so you can decide how
many hours we'll wager

240
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:53,060
on whether he's alive or dead.

241
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,220
I bet ten hours that he's alive.

242
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,220
What's this?

243
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:05,400
You were the one whining
over his being dead.

244
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:09,230
Very well. Then let's check.

245
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:12,070
You're being pretty cautious...

246
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:15,370
Weren't you going to not
say anything else?

247
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:18,490
Ten hours, huh?

248
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:22,500
This was the obvious choice.

249
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:25,070
Even if I'm wrong,

250
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:27,000
as long as we confirm his death,

251
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,280
Kurapika will have won his round.

252
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:33,130
If he's really unconscious,

253
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:35,890
I'll just kick his ass.

254
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:48,440
See? He's only unconscious.

255
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,150
So it seems.

256
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:52,650
All right...

257
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:55,010
Leorio has the lead!

258
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:56,890
This is bad.

259
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:57,660
Huh?

260
00:16:58,190 --> 00:17:01,640
It's possible he isn't going to wake up.

261
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:03,070
What do you mean?

262
00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:05,600
Remember when that woman

263
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,880
walked near the guy on the floor?

264
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,010
What of it?

265
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:10,050
I thought then

266
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:13,380
that he was already dead.

267
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:14,720
But on second thought,

268
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,520
they'd obviously prefer him alive,

269
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,060
but remaining unconscious.

270
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:23,590
If he doesn't wake up
before the test ends,

271
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:26,720
it shortens their sentences
by seventy-two years.

272
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:31,200
So if he doesn't wake up...

273
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,740
That's my point!

274
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:35,570
That's been their intention all along.

275
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:42,190
Well, it's your turn.

276
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:44,400
Decide what we'll bet on.

277
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,080
Let's see...

278
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:55,590
How about we bet on whether
he's truly unconscious?

279
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:56,590
Huh?

280
00:17:57,230 --> 00:17:58,590
I see.

281
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:05,450
Hey, what am I supposed to do?

282
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:07,690
The note didn't cover this.

283
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:15,490
When I woke up, a note next to me

284
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:18,060
told me to feign unconsciousness,

285
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:21,350
and to hide the note in my mouth.

286
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:24,750
I understood the plan immediately.

287
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:28,750
If I can buy time by pretending
to be asleep,

288
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:32,750
our sentences will be shortened
by seventy-two years!

289
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:35,500
So, then what do I do?

290
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,760
Should I stay down?

291
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:39,680
Very well.

292
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:43,010
I bet twenty hours that he
really is unconscious.

293
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,880
Okay, got it...

294
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:49,110
I'm supposed to keep acting
like I'm unconscious!

295
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:54,900
But how do we confirm whether
he's really unconscious?

296
00:18:56,330 --> 00:18:57,450
Oh...

297
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:01,230
That's simple.

298
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:05,410
This guy's heavy...

299
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:12,420
I'll just toss him off the edge.

300
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:15,420
Wh-What the hell?!

301
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:18,110
If he's actually unconscious,

302
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:21,040
he'll fall to his death.

303
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,180
Are you insane?

304
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:27,410
His match hasn't been settled yet.

305
00:19:27,410 --> 00:19:29,480
We can't accept those terms.

306
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:31,550
Don't worry.

307
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:34,190
If he falls and dies,

308
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:37,230
we'll forfeit the match,

309
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:39,450
which will give you two wins.

310
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:41,890
Is that satisfactory?

311
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:45,400
Yes,

312
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,200
it is.

313
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,190
What was that?

314
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:51,280
Don't be ridiculous...

315
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,710
We're talking about my life here!

316
00:19:54,530 --> 00:19:56,480
But then I'm changing my wager.

317
00:19:57,460 --> 00:20:01,020
I bet forty hours that he
isn't unconscious.

318
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:03,340
Everything I have left.

319
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:07,230
Heh, little sneak.

320
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:09,410
Finally showing your true colors.

321
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:25,380
Then, I'll let go of him.

322
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:29,120
Whoa! Wait!

323
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,970
I'm awake! I'm awake...

324
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:32,580
Don't let go!

325
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,090
Wait! Whoa...

326
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:39,850
I'm gonna fall!

327
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:43,090
Good morning.

328
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:48,360
You people are crazy.

329
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:50,840
I've had enough!

330
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:52,890
I'll take the loss!

331
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:55,400
Forget the sentence reduction!

332
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:59,650
It's safer in prison...

333
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:06,910
You knew that he was awake.

334
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:09,970
I actually aspire to become a doctor.

335
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:12,810
All I had to do was check
his eye movement.

336
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:19,880
However, you're down
to twenty hours.

337
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:25,380
But now we have a 2-1 lead.

338
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:30,390
Now...

339
00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:32,770
It's your turn!

340
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:35,730
What do you want to bet on?

341
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:42,760
Majitani surrenders,

342
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:45,400
giving Gon and his friends a 2-1 lead.

343
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:49,060
However, in the time-betting match,

344
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:51,710
they're down 80-20.

345
00:21:52,290 --> 00:21:56,550
What will Leroute choose to bet on?

346
00:23:28,430 --> 00:23:30,690
Next time: Trouble x With The x Gamble!

347
00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:31,800
Bulldog... Bulldog...

348
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,030
Bulldog scramble!

348
00:23:34,305 --> 00:24:34,358
