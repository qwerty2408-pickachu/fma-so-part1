1
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:07,960
Fearsome monsters... Exotic creatures...

2
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,480
Vast riches... Hidden treasures...

3
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:18,530
Evil enclaves... Unexplored lands...

4
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:23,250
The word "unknown" holds magic.

5
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:27,080
And some incredible people are
drawn to that magic.

6
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:29,290
They are known...

7
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:35,010
...as Hunters!

9
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:56,260
I...

10
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:58,760
I give!

11
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,640
Huh?

12
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,510
What?

13
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:01,760
Bastard...

14
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:05,020
You just confirmed all my suspicions!

15
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:07,060
You're a worthless piece of trash,

16
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:10,520
who's only good for sabotaging
other applicants!

17
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:12,270
Exactly.

18
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:14,310
That's what I do every year.

19
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:18,020
And I plan to continue the tradition.

20
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:23,030
I'm not looking to pass the Hunter Exam.

21
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:28,040
Beware x Of x Prisoners

22
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:33,610
The Third Phase of the exam is
taking place at Trick Tower,

23
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:36,980
a prison for long-term prisoners.

24
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:43,210
Gon and his friends have chosen to partake

25
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:46,180
in a five-on-five battle with
some of the prisoners.

26
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:50,190
Due to Tonpa's actions,
they've already suffered one loss.

27
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:53,190
The next round

28
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:55,250
will pit Gon against Sedokan.

29
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:59,790
What will happen in the upcoming battle?

30
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:02,790
Now, then...

31
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:06,450
Sedokan
149-year sentence, serial bombings

32
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:06,450
As you can see, I'm not very strong.

33
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:08,550
I don't really enjoy fistfights

34
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:11,140
or other physical activities,
such as running and jumping.

35
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:13,550
I do.

36
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:16,660
But I'm not too good at using my head.

37
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:17,960
As I thought.

38
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:22,470
So I came up with a simple game
we could both play.

39
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:23,820
A game?

40
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:24,710
Yes.

41
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:28,760
It doesn't rely on either mental
or physical activity.

42
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:29,980
What kind of game?

43
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:37,640
We each light a candle at the same time.

44
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:40,540
The one whose candle goes
out first is the loser.

45
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:41,490
What do you think?

46
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:43,570
Yeah! That's easy to understand.

47
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:45,100
Let's go with that.

48
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:47,120
Okay. In that case...

49
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:58,880
...decide which candle you want to use.

50
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:01,010
Press O for the long one,

51
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:04,240
or X for the short one.

52
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:07,890
This will be determined
by majority rule.

53
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:10,670
We have to choose one?

54
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:12,770
This is a trap!

55
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:15,550
Normally, you'd choose the long one,

56
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:19,570
so he must have done something
to the long one!

57
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:22,680
That would be the safe assumption.

58
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,420
But it might be a trick,

59
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:26,970
and he's actually tampered
with the short one.

60
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:30,890
When you put it like that...

61
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:33,040
Yes, there is no end...

62
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,930
You've got a real dilemma there.

63
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:37,650
You keep your mouth shut!

64
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:38,670
Yeah, yeah.

65
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:43,670
When presented with a
clearly uneven choice,

66
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:48,180
people become suspicious and
hesitate before deciding.

67
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:51,680
Yes, this is a real dilemma.

68
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:56,490
What's worse, if you make the wrong choice,
the resulting mental anguish

69
00:04:56,490 --> 00:05:00,870
would be much greater than if the problem
had offered two fair options.

70
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,510
Take your time.

71
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:14,960
This may be a majority decision,
but you're free to discuss it.

72
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:19,460
We have plenty of time.

73
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:20,150
Hmm...

74
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:21,960
Hey, which one should I choose?

75
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,650
Damn...

76
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:25,470
Which one should we take?

77
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:42,610
Gon, you decide!

78
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:46,630
We'll abide by your decision.

79
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:48,340
Choose the one you think is best.

80
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:49,960
Are you sure about this?

81
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:52,870
He never thinks anything through.

82
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:55,490
Instead of wasting time fretting
over what to do,

83
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:57,990
let's rely on Gon's instincts.

84
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:00,880
Instincts, huh...

85
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,660
I get to choose?

86
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:03,900
Okay!

87
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,880
Then I choose the long one!

88
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:09,390
You want the long candle?

89
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:13,890
Because a longer candle
will burn a longer time!

90
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:17,240
Er, he's just taking it at face value?

91
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:20,150
I knew he wouldn't think this through.

92
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,610
Well, that's that.

93
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,390
It's not like we can figure out
which one is the trap.

94
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:34,790
Okay.

95
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:37,490
You get the long one.

96
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:39,290
I'll take the short one.

97
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:48,760
Now, we light our candles together.

98
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,040
Normally,

99
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,040
how long would it take that
candle to burn down?

100
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:26,300
Five to six hours?

101
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:36,060
Whoa... That was close.

102
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:42,560
A strong wind is coming from below.

103
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,620
That means we should watch our step...

104
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:49,570
No time to relax, huh...

105
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:05,710
If you don't pay attention,
your candle will go out.

106
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:09,510
That's because you're planning
to do something bad.

107
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:13,470
Otherwise, your candle would go out first.

108
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:15,090
I won't do anything.

109
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:17,970
After all...

110
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:19,970
I've already taken steps.

111
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:30,480
See?

112
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:33,590
Hey! Look at Gon's candle!

113
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:35,840
The flame suddenly became stronger!

114
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:41,000
He must have hidden gunpowder or some other
highly flammable substance inside,

115
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:43,910
to make the candle burn faster!

116
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,430
H-Hot...

117
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:52,930
At this rate, his candle will only last
another two or three minutes.

118
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:54,010
Damn!

119
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:56,480
Hey! That was dirty!

120
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,260
I knew you tampered with
the long candle!

121
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:03,270
Heh, you're wrong.

122
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:06,650
I had four candles prepared.

123
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:09,560
The dilemma you faced was mere

124
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:13,030
camouflage for the actual trap.

125
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:17,780
You were given the impression that only
one candle had been interfered with.

126
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:21,520
The choices were so uneven,
you didn't consider

127
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:24,790
the possibility that both had been.

128
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:31,050
It didn't matter which candle you picked.

129
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:35,250
Either way, I would have handed you

130
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:37,550
an oil-soaked candle.

131
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:49,060
If the fire is stronger,

132
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:53,190
then a little breeze won't extinguish it.

133
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,610
He's fast!

134
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,120
I win!

135
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:10,880
Yes!

136
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:19,890
Oh, he has a real spring to his step.

137
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:23,960
And the ability to take advantage
of a bad situation.

138
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:26,890
I'm impressed by this boy.

139
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,470
Yay! I won!

140
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:34,020
Good job, Gon!

141
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:35,400
Now we have a win!

142
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:38,690
Once Kurapika and I win,
we can advance!

143
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:42,310
Hmph, you fool.

144
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:44,910
That's the result of reliance on
tools and cheap tricks.

145
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:47,910
Tsk.

146
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:51,990
If you want to fool someone,
you have to sacrifice a bit.

147
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:53,420
Just watch.

148
00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:01,780
All right.

149
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:03,430
I'll go next.

150
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:54,150
Hunter Vocabulary

151
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:54,150
Lippo

152
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:59,640
I'm next!

153
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:03,160
Majitani
108-year sentence, multiple crimes, including fraud and blackmail

154
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,410
That's one freaky body...

155
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:07,410
And face...

156
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,410
Look here!

157
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:16,260
I've killed nineteen people,

158
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:20,420
but it bugs me that nineteen is
such an uneven number.

159
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:25,930
I'm so glad I've gotten to
meet number twenty.

160
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:32,560
Now we have a serial killer?

161
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:36,950
I insist that we put our lives on the line.

162
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:39,570
I won't accept some half-assed contest.

163
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:41,070
Blood!

164
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:43,070
Entrails!

165
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:45,570
Agony!

166
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:50,250
Well?

167
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:53,080
You must be scared now...

168
00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:55,050
Very well.

169
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:56,080
Huh?

170
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:58,710
You can decide how we
settle this contest.

171
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:00,440
I'll agree to your choice.

172
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,190
O-Oh...

173
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:03,970
You've got balls.

174
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:05,420
Hmph...

175
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:08,150
I know you're quaking in your boots.

176
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:11,720
How long can you maintain
the tough guy act?

177
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:14,530
In that case, I also propose

178
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:17,500
a death match, where we fight until

179
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:20,820
one of us surrenders or dies.

180
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:25,640
However, don't expect me to stop

181
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:30,200
when you surrender and
beg for your life!

182
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:34,580
Well?

183
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:36,740
Surely you're scared stiff now?

184
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:39,640
Very well. I accept.

185
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,250
Huh?

186
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:47,760
Let us begin.

187
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:50,630
Is he an idiot?

188
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:52,580
Didn't he hear what I said?

189
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:55,770
We're fighting to the death!

190
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:59,770
Wait, he should have been scared
once he saw me!

191
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:01,580
Hold on.

192
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:03,280
I forgot to mention something.

193
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:06,260
No weapons allowed.

194
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:08,780
We'll beat each other to death
with our fists.

195
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:13,750
After all, while I may be hired as
an examiner, I'm still a prisoner.

196
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:17,620
I'm not allowed to carry weapons.

197
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,530
I see.

198
00:14:19,530 --> 00:14:21,290
I understand.

199
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:26,430
Anything else?

200
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:28,650
If not, I'd like to get started.

201
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:29,760
Huh?

202
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:33,850
That little bastard...

203
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:36,290
He had a concealed weapon!

204
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:38,320
That was close.

205
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,670
However, it appears that
he doesn't rely on it.

206
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:44,560
He's that confident in his fighting ability?

207
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,530
No, that doesn't seem to be the case.

208
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:51,500
Hmph, maybe he wants to run,

209
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:55,220
but he can't in front of his friends.

210
00:14:55,850 --> 00:15:01,460
Or he's so stupid, he can't even imagine

211
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:03,080
how scary I am?

212
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:06,090
Yes! That must be it...

213
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:10,960
Well, in that case,

214
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:14,600
I have a couple of cards up my sleeve
for dealing with such fools.

215
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:27,160
Hey, now.

216
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,970
Is Kurapika gonna be okay?

217
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:31,610
This guy looks dangerous.

218
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:35,120
In what way does he look dangerous?

219
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,320
As far as I can tell,

220
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:41,210
this guy's just a blowhard who
doesn't have the guts

221
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:44,130
to hit anyone, let alone kill anyone.

222
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:46,400
You don't need to worry.

223
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,130
Huh?

224
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:48,720
Why not?

225
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,960
Because when I look at him,
I don't get chills.

226
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,140
What does that mean?

227
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:03,650
Time to show you the ace up my sleeve!

228
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:06,850
I'll see you dead!

229
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:07,860
Here he comes!

230
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:21,550
Wow...

231
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:23,790
He made a hole in the floor
with his bare fist!

232
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,260
That was perfect...

233
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:32,800
And I still have one more trick.

234
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:49,860
A tattoo of a spider with twelve legs...

235
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:51,030
That's...

236
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:53,530
Yeah, I recognize it.

237
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:59,030
Anyone aspiring to become
a Hunter has heard of it.

238
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:04,160
That's the symbol worn by members of
that notorious band of evil thieves,

239
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,940
the Phantom Troupe!

240
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:10,950
Really?

241
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:13,510
Yeah, definitely.

242
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:15,050
They're famous.

243
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:19,050
I heard about them
straight from Kurapika.

244
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:34,070
Between the steel implanted in my body

245
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:37,520
that gives my arms
the strength to shatter rock,

246
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,580
and the Phantom Troupe symbol...

247
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:42,580
After seeing both,

248
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:46,260
no one would want to fight me!

249
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,580
What's wrong?

250
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:52,470
Cat got your tongue?

251
00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:59,790
I'm Majitani, one of the
Phantom Troupe's four kings!

252
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:02,100
Consider that first strike
my way of saying hello.

253
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:05,840
This is your last chance to surrender.

254
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,070
I'm still willing to...

255
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:10,520
Huh?

256
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:24,540
Wh-What's wrong with you?

257
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:26,040
Huh?

258
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,500
Wh-What?

259
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,010
O-O-Okay...

260
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:40,750
Wait! I get it!

261
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:42,750
I surrender!

262
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:07,960
Consider this a warning...

263
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,970
First,

264
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:15,560
a real Phantom Troupe tattoo has the
member's number on the spider.

265
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:18,520
Second,

266
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:23,550
they don't bother counting
how many they've killed.

267
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:26,030
Third,

268
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:29,030
never mention the Troupe again.

269
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:32,340
If you do,

270
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:35,420
I'll kill you.

271
00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:48,520
Wow...

272
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,250
Kurapika...

273
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:54,990
Well, saw that coming
from a mile away.

274
00:19:56,210 --> 00:19:57,250
Yup...

275
00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:11,930
You okay, Kurapika?

276
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:14,690
Yeah, I'm not injured.

277
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:16,130
Also,

278
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:18,490
is it safe for us to be near you?

279
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:25,780
From the moment I saw him,
I knew he was weak.

280
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:31,260
And mentally, I knew that
tattoo was a fake.

281
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:34,150
But as soon as I saw that spider,

282
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:36,790
everything in my sight turned red...

283
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,960
Well, I can't really blame you.

284
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,890
Actually, to tell the truth...

285
00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:42,800
Hmm?

286
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:46,040
Even when I see a real spider,

287
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:48,810
my personality changes,
and I enter a frenzy.

288
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:53,810
You should have told us sooner...

289
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,130
But this means that

290
00:20:57,130 --> 00:21:01,290
the rage in me remains
as strong as ever.

291
00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:03,780
I suppose I should be happy.

292
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:08,060
We should keep Kurapika
away from spiders.

293
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:09,220
Definitely.

294
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:12,790
Damn you, Majitani...

295
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:15,580
You were completely worthless.

296
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:19,500
His facial scars were from a botched
plastic surgery operation.

297
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,590
That's one hell of a fraud.

298
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:24,440
Hey, you understand, right?

299
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:26,760
After two losses, our backs
are against the wall.

300
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,100
Let me handle it.

301
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:30,920
I have a good idea.

302
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:39,610
Okay! I'll secure our victory!

303
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:44,610
Kurapika has defeated Majitani.

304
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:49,200
Another win, and they
will clear this trial.

305
00:21:51,530 --> 00:21:55,170
How will Leorio handle

306
00:21:55,170 --> 00:21:57,670
the next challenge?

307
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:29,780
Next time: Trick x To The x Trick!

308
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:32,680
The trick to the trick is to trick...
I can't say it.

309
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,050
Don't just give up.

309
00:23:35,305 --> 00:24:35,851
