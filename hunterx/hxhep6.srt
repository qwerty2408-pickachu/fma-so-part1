1
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:07,960
Fearsome monsters... Exotic creatures...

2
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,480
Vast riches... Hidden treasures...

3
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:18,530
Evil enclaves... Unexplored lands...

4
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:23,250
The word "unknown" holds magic.

5
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:27,080
And some incredible people are
drawn to that magic.

6
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:29,590
They are known...

7
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:35,010
...as Hunters!

9
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:01,760
How wonderful...

10
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:05,020
I really do love that look.

11
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,060
But I was pretty excited, as well.

12
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:13,550
I was so scared, I wanted to run away.

13
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:15,320
But I couldn't.

14
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:18,040
And at the same time, I was excited.

15
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,320
Isn't that strange?

16
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:24,330
A x Surprising x Challenge

17
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,340
Looks like we made it in time.

18
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:41,970
Leorio...

19
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:49,710
Leorio!

20
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:54,490
Man, that stings...

21
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:56,570
Why am I all beat up?

22
00:02:56,570 --> 00:02:57,660
Huh?

23
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:00,590
My memory is kinda hazy.

24
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:03,640
We probably shouldn't tell
him what happened.

25
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:04,700
Yeah...

26
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:06,330
Gon.

27
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:07,840
Killua!

28
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,020
I can't believe you actually got here...

29
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:12,830
I thought you were done for.

30
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:16,260
I just tracked Leorio's cologne.

31
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:17,320
Cologne?

32
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,770
That was how?

33
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:21,970
You definitely are weird.

34
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,600
Excellent work, everyone.

35
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:29,100
Phase Two of the exam will occur here,
in the Biska Forest Park.

36
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:31,710
So, I shall take my leave.

37
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:34,360
Best of luck to all of you.

38
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:56,700
Will all applicants who passed
the First Phase please enter?

39
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,900
Welcome.

40
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:02,900
I'm Menchi, the Second Phase examiner.

41
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:05,640
And I'm Buhara, the other examiner.

42
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:15,900
Wh-What was that sound?

43
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:18,500
You must be hungry.

44
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,650
I'm starving...

45
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:23,650
There you have it.
Phase Two will involve...

46
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,160
...cooking!

47
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,280
C-Cooking?

48
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,540
Wait! Cooking?

49
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:36,900
We're here to take the Hunter Exam!

50
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:37,930
That's quite right.

51
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:42,710
Your challenge for the Second Phase is to produce
a dish that will satisfy our palate.

52
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:44,480
Why do we have to cook?!

53
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,480
That's because

54
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:49,560
we are Gourmet Hunters.

55
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:52,190
Huh?

56
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:57,140
Man, what a letdown.

57
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:58,940
They're Gourmet Hunters...

58
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:05,950
The Gourmet Hunters Menchi and Buhara...

59
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:10,780
Their selection as examiners
could prove problematic.

60
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:14,140
Only fifty applicants...

61
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:16,130
No, depending on the task,

62
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:19,790
it's possible that fewer than ten
applicants will pass Phase Two.

63
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:26,800
So, Gourmet Hunters,
what are we supposed to make?

64
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:29,430
Buhara.

65
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:35,180
The required ingredient is pork.

66
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:36,540
Pork?

67
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:38,590
As in pig meat?

68
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:42,660
You're free to use meat from any
species of Biska Forest pigs.

69
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:47,450
You must use the cooking facilities here
to prepare the pork.

70
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:51,940
And you only pass if we both
find it delicious.

71
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:54,530
And we will evaluate more
than just the taste.

72
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:56,560
Don't underestimate the
intricacies of cooking.

73
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,580
Got it?

74
00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:00,790
When we've both eaten our fill,

75
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:02,620
the exam will end.

76
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:04,310
We get it. We get it.

77
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:05,840
Let's just start.

78
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:08,920
Then, the exam's Second Phase

79
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:11,850
begins now!

80
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:21,080
Free to use meat from any species of pigs?

81
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,390
You have a real nasty streak.

82
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:26,110
Choosing the ingredients was my job.

83
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:30,860
Only one species of pig lives in
the Biska Forest, correct?

84
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,620
I hope they don't get themselves killed.

85
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:42,580
Hey, little piggy?

86
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:45,850
Catch a pig and cook it.

87
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:48,010
This is way easier than the First Phase.

88
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,220
I hope it will be that simple...

89
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:02,240
What was that about, Gon?!

90
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:03,340
Found them.

91
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,260
Huh?

92
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:05,280
Pigs!

93
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:12,000
Uh... They're chewing on bones.

94
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,320
Don't tell me...

95
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:15,400
They're carnivores?

96
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:25,880
Huh?

97
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:26,840
What's that?

98
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:40,850
These pigs are crazy!

99
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:43,100
The Great Stamp,

100
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:46,360
the world's most ferocious pig.

101
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:51,010
They use their large, stout noses
to send their enemies flying.

102
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:56,240
If you're too slow, you'll end up
as their dinner.

103
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,660
Take that!

104
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,080
What?

105
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:04,120
Huh?

106
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:31,280
Just maybe...

107
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:51,270
Could their foreheads be
their weak points?

108
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:53,050
So, the pigs evolved large,

109
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:57,300
strong noses in order to protect
their soft foreheads.

110
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,320
Oh, my. They caught a lot.

111
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:31,050
This year's applicants are very talented.

112
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:35,630
However, the difficult part is yet to come.

113
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:39,640
Now eat the pig and send me
to the next phase.

114
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:42,890
Okay, it's evaluation time.

115
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,640
Taste testing.

116
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:50,650
Tastes good!

117
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:55,920
It's overcooked.

118
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,910
The tough texture ruins the
flavor of the meat.

119
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:01,570
What? You haven't even tried it!

120
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:03,180
It's plain as day.

121
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:04,540
Damn it...

122
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,290
Okay... Dive in!

123
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:13,170
Huh? Why?

124
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:16,380
Charred on the outside,
uncooked inside.

125
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:17,930
Your fire was too strong.

126
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:27,540
Honestly...

127
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:31,900
All they're doing is roasting the whole pig,
like it's all they know how to do...

128
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,820
None of them has made any effort!

129
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:38,450
No one's passed yet...

130
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:42,450
And Menchi hasn't even taken a bite...

131
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,210
Hey!

132
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:47,960
Can't anyone out there satisfy me?

133
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:49,350
That's it!

134
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:51,410
This phase of the exam is a cooking test,

135
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:54,920
but they're judging us on originality
and powers of observation.

136
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:57,380
I see...

137
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:01,390
How do you like my cooking?

138
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:03,800
Is this supposed to be a kiddy meal?!

139
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,390
I'm next!

140
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:11,060
It's basically the same thing!

141
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,650
I am next!

142
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,790
Please judge my creation.

143
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,900
Finally, something that
resembles an actual dish...

144
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:24,410
The point is to use the provided
facilities and ingredients

145
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:28,060
to highlight the main feature, the pork.

146
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:31,540
In other words, the taste is insignificant!

147
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:33,440
Yuck!

148
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:36,050
Huh?

149
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:38,140
Appearance is important,

150
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:39,980
but only if it also tastes good.

151
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:42,770
You're no better than #403!

152
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:46,880
Too bad!

153
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,180
No better than #403...

154
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:53,380
That was so much food,

155
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,390
I'm stuffed!

156
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:58,510
Yeah, I'm stuffed, too.

157
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:00,820
Therefore, no one passes.

158
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:03,210
We're finished here!

159
00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:04,280
It's over?

160
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,400
What the hell?

161
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:09,000
As I expected, she's lapsed back
into her old bad habits.

162
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,830
What should we do, Chairman?

163
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:17,390
I suppose I have no choice.

164
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:22,090
Fine, I'll have to go in person.

165
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:32,180
Hunter Vocabulary

166
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:32,180
Menchi

167
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,440
Zero people passed?

168
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,930
Are you serious?

169
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:37,960
Does she really mean it?

170
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:40,440
The exam is over?

171
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,480
This isn't funny!

172
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,410
I won't accept it...

173
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:48,950
I absolutely refuse to accept this!

174
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,670
In the end, you've still failed.

175
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:52,820
Stop screwing around!

176
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:55,570
You asked for pork,

177
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:56,730
so we risked our lives to—

178
00:12:56,730 --> 00:12:58,730
I said to prepare the pork in a manner

179
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:00,890
we both found delicious...

180
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:03,840
None of you made anything
remotely delicious.

181
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,090
You all did almost the same thing.

182
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,350
There was no effort made...

183
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:12,100
Just when I thought someone actually tried,
they only changed the appearance.

184
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:14,600
No one attempted to emphasize the flavor.

185
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:17,350
I'm positive that none of you
took cooking seriously!

186
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:21,780
Pork dishes are all the same...

187
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:23,930
Just say that once more.

188
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:25,680
Any more crap from you,

189
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,820
and I'll shove my arm up your ass
and knock your teeth out!

190
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:30,900
Don't you mess with me!

191
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:32,160
There's Menchi's bad habit again...

192
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:33,670
I don't want any lip from a bunch of

193
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,610
After all, only a handful of chefs

194
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:36,270
amateurs who can't even roast a pig!

195
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:38,520
in the entire world can satisfy Menchi.

196
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:38,150
Hey! What did you just say?

197
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:39,670
Why don't you repeat it to my face?!

198
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:42,460
In other words, you people

199
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:46,680
don't have the guts to try anything new.

200
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:48,120
Shut up!

201
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:50,900
I'm not trying to become
a cook or a gourmet...

202
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:51,990
I want to be a Hunter!

203
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:53,910
Yeah! Yeah!

204
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:56,370
My goal is to become a Black List Hunter.

205
00:13:56,370 --> 00:14:00,050
I refuse to let a mere Gourmet Hunter
decide my fate!

206
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:02,060
Too bad you got stuck with a mere

207
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:03,690
Gourmet Hunter as an examiner...

208
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:05,840
Better luck next year?

209
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:08,700
Why, you...

210
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:10,530
Don't mock me!

211
00:14:15,530 --> 00:14:18,400
Buhara, don't interfere.

212
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,780
Well...

213
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:23,380
If I hadn't intervened,
you'd have killed him, right?

214
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:25,580
Probably.

215
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:28,880
Let me clarify this...

216
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,070
We frequently venture into the dens

217
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:33,810
of ferocious beasts,
searching for ingredients.

218
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:38,720
Every Hunter knows some form
of martial art.

219
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:42,770
You lack focus and the willingness
to experiment.

220
00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:46,440
That alone disqualifies you
from becoming Hunters!

221
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:55,950
That said,

222
00:14:56,350 --> 00:15:00,710
it would be excessive to fail
every single applicant.

223
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:05,800
That's the symbol of the
Hunters Association!

224
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,530
Is it someone from the
Selection Committee?

225
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,740
Wh-Who's that geezer?

226
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:35,440
The Chairman of the
Selection Committee.

227
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,490
He's in charge of the Hunter Exam...

228
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:40,640
Chairman Netero.

229
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:44,410
Well, I work behind the scenes.

230
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:48,790
I only take action when there's
an issue, like now.

231
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:50,760
So, Menchi-kun...

232
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:52,010
Yes, sir.

233
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:57,010
You failed all of the applicants because

234
00:15:57,010 --> 00:15:59,770
you disapproved of their reluctance

235
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:02,440
to try new things?

236
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:03,770
No, sir...

237
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:07,730
I lost my cool when one
of the candidates

238
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:09,410
insulted Gourmet Hunters.

239
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:12,780
And I made the exam harder
than necessary.

240
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:17,910
In other words, you're aware that
this exam was unacceptable.

241
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:19,070
Yes, sir.

242
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:22,170
When cooking is involved,
I lose control.

243
00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:24,270
I'm unqualified to be an examiner.

244
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,840
I will resign as examiner,

245
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,920
so please redo the Second Phase!

246
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:32,400
But it would be difficult to find

247
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,600
another examiner on such short notice.

248
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,430
I apologize...

249
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:39,310
Very well. How about this?

250
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:41,930
I'd like you to continue serving
as an examiner.

251
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:44,160
But you must also participate

252
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,820
in the new test you propose.

253
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:52,190
Is that acceptable?

254
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:53,620
I'm certain that will help

255
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:56,700
the applicants to accept the results.

256
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:58,310
That's true...

257
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:01,640
Then the new challenge will be

258
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:03,460
boiled eggs!

259
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,290
Boiled eggs?

260
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:08,850
Chairman, can you take us
to Mt. Split-in-Half

261
00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:11,730
in your airship?

262
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:13,420
Mt. Split-in-Half?

263
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:15,000
I see what you're doing.

264
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,180
Certainly, I can.

265
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:26,430
Now, everyone...

266
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:28,110
Look down there.

267
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:31,230
Wh-What is that?

268
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,380
A Spider Eagle's web.

269
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:35,490
They build webs down there?

270
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:41,490
Look below the web.

271
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:43,250
Those are...

272
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:45,380
Those are Spider Eagle eggs.

273
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:49,040
Spider Eagles build their webs in deep ravines,

274
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:52,590
to protect their eggs from predators.

275
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:54,260
This makes their eggs

276
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:58,260
one of the most difficult
ingredients to obtain.

277
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:02,100
The eggs are also known as dream eggs.

278
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:03,860
W-Wait a minute...

279
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:04,770
You don't mean we...

280
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:06,350
I sure do.

281
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:07,020
What?

282
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:23,900
Even if she can grab some eggs,

283
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:25,660
how will she climb back up?

284
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:41,970
Hey... She jumped down!

285
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,670
Is she trying to kill herself?

286
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:46,220
No, she's not.

287
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:46,730
Huh?

288
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,890
That looks fun...

289
00:18:57,890 --> 00:19:01,800
This ravine has updrafts

290
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:07,250
that help the hatched chicks
fly up to the web.

291
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:10,750
There. Now I just need to boil the egg.

292
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:12,930
Y-You must be joking.

293
00:19:12,930 --> 00:19:16,790
No reasonable person would
jump down there...

294
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:18,610
I've been waiting for this!

295
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:24,890
Okay! Count me in!

296
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,020
Wait!

297
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:31,480
I haven't finished explaining everything!

298
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:39,610
Catch you later.

299
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:41,250
Let's go!

300
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:42,820
Not yet.

301
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:43,890
Why not?

302
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:44,990
There's no wind.

303
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:47,910
There isn't always an updraft.

304
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:53,310
When's the next one?

305
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:54,260
Wait.

306
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:04,800
What?

307
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:07,890
The web won't hold us all!

308
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:09,770
Gon, not yet?

309
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:15,390
Damn, I can't wait for an updraft!

310
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:24,660
It's gonna snap!

311
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:26,160
Now!

312
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,310
And the rest of you?

313
00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:54,130
I guess you quit.

314
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:56,930
It takes courage to concede, too.

315
00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:06,280
This is damned good.

316
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:09,520
Much better than the eggs
you buy in a store...

317
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,080
I can see why they're
called dream eggs.

318
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:18,730
Hey, Todo-san.

319
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:21,590
Would you like a bite?

320
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:27,510
It's delicious...

321
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:29,970
Now you've experienced the joy
of discovering

322
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:32,730
how good something can taste.

323
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:36,380
We're risking our lives for that joy.

324
00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:40,260
I was completely outclassed this year.

325
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:42,610
I'll be back next year!

326
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:47,280
The applicants have learned that,

327
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:51,330
whether you're a Black List Hunter
or a Gourmet Hunter,

328
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:56,060
calling yourself a Hunter requires an
enormous amount of determination.

329
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:00,550
Only 42 applicants remain.

330
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:30,850
Next time: Showdown x On The x Airship!

331
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:33,260
Use soap when you wash your hands!

332
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:34,420
R-Right!

332
00:23:35,305 --> 00:24:35,851
