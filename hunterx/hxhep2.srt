1
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:07,960
Fearsome monsters... Exotic creatures...

2
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,110
Vast riches... Hidden treasures...

3
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:18,280
Evil enclaves... Unexplored lands...

4
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:23,250
The word "unknown" holds magic.

5
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:27,080
And some incredible people are
drawn to that magic.

6
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:29,590
They are known...

7
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:35,010
...as Hunters!

9
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:56,760
Okay!

10
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,400
I'll take responsibility for bringing

11
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:03,210
you three to the port closest to the exam site.

12
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:07,120
Yay!

13
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:14,610
Test x Of x Tests

14
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:18,970
Dolle Harbor

15
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,860
After winning the captain's favor,

16
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:23,370
the trio of Gon, Kurapika, and Leorio

17
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:26,870
arrived safely at Dolle Harbor.

18
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:28,620
Thanks, Captain!

19
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,110
I had a great time!

20
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:34,250
I had fun, too.

21
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:38,120
Right! As a token of my appreciation,

22
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,760
I'll give you some advice.

23
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,200
Advice?

24
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:46,370
Look. See that big cedar tree on the hilltop?

25
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:47,390
Uh-huh.

26
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:49,930
You should make your way there first.

27
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:52,270
It's a shortcut to the exam site.

28
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:53,520
A shortcut?

29
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,530
Got it!

30
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:56,280
So, I just need to head for that tree!

31
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,090
I'll do that, Captain!

32
00:02:58,090 --> 00:02:59,280
Thanks!

33
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,780
Best of luck!

34
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:03,020
Yep! Same to you!

35
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:05,120
Take care!

36
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:08,490
Rest easy, Ging.

37
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:11,920
Your son has grown into a respectable young man.

38
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:19,320
Huh... That's strange.

39
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,310
Why?

40
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:23,680
According to the notice I received,

41
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,510
the exam is supposedly being held
somewhere in Zaban City.

42
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:30,020
Right now, we're here.

43
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:34,020
That tree is in the opposite direction.

44
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:36,190
Perhaps you misheard him?

45
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:40,080
No, he told me to head toward that cedar tree.

46
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,400
I see...

47
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,940
And this notice isn't any help!

48
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:49,040
Where, exactly, in Zaban City
are we meant to go?

49
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:53,140
Our task is to find the exam site,
using a limited amount of information.

50
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:56,240
Just another test before we'll be allowed
to take the Hunter Exam.

51
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,590
I-I knew that...

52
00:03:58,590 --> 00:03:59,800
I already knew that!

53
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,230
Anyway, I'll go have a look.

54
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:04,430
The captain must have had
a reason to suggest that.

55
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:05,410
Hey, hey...

56
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:06,300
You're serious?

57
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:09,520
The bus to Zaban is about to leave.

58
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,290
We should just take it.

59
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,440
Hey!

60
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,180
Man...

61
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:19,430
He's gotta learn that you
can't trust everyone.

62
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:20,410
Huh?

63
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:21,260
Hey!

64
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:22,190
Kurapika!

65
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:26,950
Gon's behavior interests me more
than the captain's advice.

66
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,710
I'm going with him.

67
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:31,430
Oh, is that so?

68
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:32,490
See ya.

69
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:34,960
Wasn't very long... Nice knowing you.

70
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:38,710
Guess he's not as independent as I'd thought...

71
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:41,070
I'm just gonna take the bus!

72
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:42,590
So it was a trap...

73
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,350
Seems none of the buses have
made it to Zaban City.

74
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:52,510
Rookies usually fail this part
because they're too naïve.

75
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:55,100
Wait, wait, wait!

76
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,850
Wait for me!

77
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:04,120
Well, I knew you guys would
be lonely without me.

78
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,260
And it's no fun traveling alone.

79
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:10,090
So I decided to stick with you
guys a while longer.

80
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:21,990
This is a creepy place...

81
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:24,050
I don't see a single person.

82
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:26,910
No, there are plenty here.

83
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:28,300
What?

84
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:44,940
Wh-What's with the freak show?

85
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:47,450
Exciting...

86
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:49,450
E-Exciting?

87
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,950
Exciting...

88
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:53,110
Exciting.

89
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:58,960
Exciting two-choice quiz!

90
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:11,470
You boys are headed for that
tree on the hill, correct?

91
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:13,910
To reach that tree,

92
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:17,110
you must pass through this town.

93
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:17,980
Huh?

94
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:21,410
I shall administer a single-question quiz.

95
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:22,680
H-Hold on!

96
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,270
What's going on here?

97
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:26,740
You'll have five seconds to state your answer.

98
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:29,610
Give the wrong answer, and you're disqualified.

99
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:32,740
You'll have to give up on taking
this year's Hunter Exam.

100
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:34,360
I see...

101
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:37,570
Then this is part of the Hunter Exam.

102
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:39,220
I see how it is.

103
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:41,110
I happen to be a quiz expert.

104
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:42,500
Wait. Only one question?

105
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:45,770
Your answer will be either the number 1 or 2.

106
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:50,010
Any other answer will be considered incorrect.

107
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,780
Hold on!

108
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:53,860
All three of us share one question?

109
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:57,270
So if one of them answers incorrectly,
I'm disqualified, too?

110
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:59,110
As if that would happen!

111
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:02,550
What scares me is the high likelihood
of the vice versa happening.

112
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:03,590
What was that?

113
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:04,590
But you know...

114
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:08,770
This way's easier, since only one of us
needs to know the answer.

115
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:10,880
I'm not good at quizzes.

116
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:11,590
I suppose...

117
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:12,460
Fair point.

118
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:15,660
Hey, there. Hurry it up.

119
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:18,450
Or else I'll answer the question first.

120
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:19,990
Who are you?

121
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:23,880
He followed us here, all the way from port.

122
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,460
Huh? Seriously?

123
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:27,280
Sorry, kid.

124
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,720
I happened to overhear your conversation.

125
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,430
What will you do?

126
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:34,310
He seems eager to take it.

127
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:35,760
We should let him go first.

128
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,930
That way, we'll know what kind
of question to expect.

129
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:39,570
I don't mind.

130
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:40,900
I have no objection.

131
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:42,480
Then I'll get to it.

132
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,020
Fools.

133
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:48,230
I'll leave a trail of traps behind me.

134
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:50,820
Here is your question...

135
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:56,050
Evil villains have captured your mother and lover.

136
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:58,400
You can only save one.

137
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,500
Select 1 for your mother, or 2 for your lover.

138
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:04,120
Which will you save?

139
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:07,290
H-How is this even a quiz?

140
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:12,550
The answer is 1.

141
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:15,300
Oh? Why do you say that?

142
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:18,990
Because you can't replace your mother.

143
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:21,590
But you can find another lover.

144
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:22,560
What?

145
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,820
You may pass.

146
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:29,070
What?

147
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:33,700
You just have to tell the old lady
what she wants to hear.

148
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:35,200
Adios.

149
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,780
Hey, now! That's all bull!

150
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:39,950
How was that the right answer?

151
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:42,960
We're supposed to give the answer
the old lady wants?

152
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:45,210
And that's considered correct?

153
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,360
Hey, say something!

154
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:52,050
I won't put up with this sham.

155
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:53,680
I'll find a different route.

156
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,830
It's too late.

157
00:08:55,720 --> 00:09:00,470
Refuse to take the quiz, and you're disqualified.

158
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:03,080
Th-That's just ridiculous!

159
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:05,960
Different people would expect different answers!

160
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:09,230
There is no right answer!

161
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:12,180
No right answer...

162
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:13,990
I see!

163
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:15,990
Leorio!

164
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:16,990
Wait!

165
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:22,490
The cat-eyed boy has figured it out.

166
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:25,310
Not another word from you.

167
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,340
Say anything but the answer,

168
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:29,000
and you're immediately disqualified.

169
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,520
Wake up, Leorio...

170
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,780
It's a simple trick...

171
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:37,010
Gon...

172
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:39,230
Here is your question...

173
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:44,800
Your son and daughter have been kidnapped.

174
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,610
You can only rescue one.

175
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:50,770
Select 1 for your son, or 2 for your daughter.

176
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:53,500
Which will you rescue?

177
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:56,030
She's making fun of us...

178
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:58,470
Five.

179
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:03,160
Go ahead and count down, you hag.

180
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:02,270
Four.

181
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:05,130
Three.

182
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:08,170
Two.

183
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:11,210
One.

184
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:16,750
Buzz. Time's up.

185
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:29,020
Don't stop me, Kurapika!

186
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:32,690
I won't be satisfied until I've
taught this hag a lesson!

187
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:34,190
Calm down, Leorio!

188
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:36,880
How am I supposed to calm down?

189
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,490
You'll waste our correct response.

190
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,240
Correct response?

191
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,930
We gave the right answer.

192
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:48,000
Silence was the correct response.

193
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,530
Silence? What do you mean...

194
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:53,240
You hit the nail on the head.

195
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:57,760
There is no right answer!

196
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:58,810
Precisely.

197
00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:01,040
This quiz had no right answer.

198
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:04,390
However, we could only state
1 or 2 as the answer.

199
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:07,070
In other words, we weren't meant
to respond at all.

200
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:08,770
Silence was the only response.

201
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:10,840
But what about that other guy?

202
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:14,600
They never said he gave the right answer.
She only said, "You may pass."

203
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:18,280
In other words, this path is the wrong path.

204
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,460
Am I right?

205
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,250
Precisely.

206
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,960
The correct path is over here.

207
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,530
This leads directly to the tree.

208
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:32,290
Walk two hours, and you'll reach the top.

209
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,290
Oh, so that's what this was about...

210
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:40,430
A couple lives in the cabin beneath that tree.

211
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:42,050
They serve as Navigators.

212
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:48,060
If you meet their standards, I believe that
they will guide you to the exam site.

213
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,900
Gran, I'm sorry for my rudeness.

214
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:56,190
Don't be. I don't mind.

215
00:11:56,190 --> 00:12:00,610
I do this job because I enjoy
meeting people like you.

216
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:01,700
Huh?

217
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,950
Do your best to become a good Hunter.

218
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:19,210
It's no use. I can't think of an answer.

219
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:24,680
You were still trying to find an answer?

220
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:25,700
You can stop.

221
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:27,360
Huh? Why?

222
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,440
The quiz is over.

223
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,260
I know.

224
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:31,980
But...

225
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:33,580
But you know...

226
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:36,490
What if I run into a situation like that

227
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:40,040
and I can only save one person...

228
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,490
What should I do then?

229
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:45,490
It wouldn't be right to choose just one...

230
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:51,250
But one day, I might have
to make that choice.

231
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:58,640
That's right.

232
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:02,460
That is the true purpose of this test.

233
00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:06,720
You must be prepared to face the
worst possible scenarios...

234
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:11,590
Because harsh reality strikes without warning.

235
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:15,880
You must be prepared for
the day your paths diverge.

236
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:28,070
Hunter Vocabulary

237
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:28,070
Kurapika

238
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,740
It's totally dark out...

239
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:33,260
"Walk two hours," she said?

240
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:35,650
It was two hours, two hours ago!

241
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:36,750
Damn.

242
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,750
Beware of Magical Beasts!

243
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:43,160
Another "Beware of Magical Beasts" sign?

244
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:46,630
Are we ever gonna make it to the exam site?

245
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:48,540
I'm hungry!

246
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:50,260
I need to take a dump!

247
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,260
Leorio!

248
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:51,640
We'll leave you behind!

249
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:52,490
I've gotta take a leak, too!

250
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:53,280
I see it.

251
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:53,890
Hey!

252
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,900
Hello? Anyone home?

253
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:04,260
Are they out?

254
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:07,970
We're coming in.

255
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:16,980
It's a Magical Beast!

256
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:17,790
A Magical Beast?

257
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:19,720
A Transforming Magical Beast, the Kiriko!

258
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,290
They can take human form!

259
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:23,550
That's an extremely intelligent creature!

260
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:25,220
There's a woman in his arms!

261
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:27,510
And the guy on the floor
needs medical attention...

262
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:33,600
P-Please...

263
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,140
Please save my wife...

264
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:38,740
Leorio, we'll leave the injured man to you!

265
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:39,900
Got it!

266
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:53,120
He can follow that faint shadow,
even through this dark forest.

267
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:59,040
Impressive.

268
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,880
Kiriko! Let her go!

269
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:06,860
Take her from me, if you can!

270
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:13,070
Wow! He can talk!

271
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:16,240
That Magical Beast,
the Kiriko, uses human speech.

272
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:19,320
Oh. That makes this a lot easier!

273
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:24,110
Hey! Silly Kiriko!

274
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:24,980
What?

275
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:28,360
H-He's fast!

276
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:32,070
Kurapika!

277
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:38,200
He's so reckless...

278
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:40,120
Stupid kid.

279
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,410
You'll pay for this!

280
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:42,210
Wait!

281
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:49,880
Are you okay?

282
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,970
Are you injured anywhere?

283
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:53,440
I'm okay.

284
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,880
What about my husband?

285
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:55,970
How is he?

286
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:57,420
Don't worry.

287
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:59,230
Our friend is taking care of him.

288
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:01,980
Please take me to my husband!

289
00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:04,730
Those tattoos...

290
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:09,870
You're...

291
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:10,780
Kurapika!

292
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:12,960
You okay?

293
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:13,990
Leorio?

294
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:16,850
Whew... Guess you guys are all right.

295
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:18,740
How is that man?

296
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:21,310
Yeah, no worries.

297
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:24,110
The wound wasn't as deep as it looked.

298
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:27,780
I gave him some painkillers,
and he's sound asleep in the cabin.

299
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:28,710
I see...

300
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,260
How did you know?

301
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:45,230
How did you know I was an impostor?

302
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:50,540
I didn't think that you were.

303
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:55,160
I told Leorio to take care of the
injured man, and he consented.

304
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:58,980
Given the Magical Beast is still on the loose,

305
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:04,670
I attacked you for foolishly leaving
an injured man on his own.

306
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:06,170
That's all.

307
00:17:09,810 --> 00:17:12,670
Now I need you to answer my question.

308
00:17:13,210 --> 00:17:15,480
Who are you?

309
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:25,690
Wait!

310
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,590
For a kid, you're pretty quick.

311
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:53,090
Didn't expect you'd land a blow on me.

312
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:00,390
You're about to discover

313
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:05,880
the high price that accomplishment came with!

314
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:15,740
Who are you?

315
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:23,240
You aren't the one I hit.

316
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,750
Are you his friend?

317
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:31,250
How can you tell that I'm not the same one?

318
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:32,400
Huh?

319
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,510
Your face is completely different.

320
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:38,690
And your voice is a little higher and thinner.

321
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:45,840
What?

322
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,620
Did I say something funny?

323
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,610
Hey, sweetheart!

324
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:51,640
Come out here!

325
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,740
You're gonna love this!

326
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:56,530
Hmm...

327
00:18:56,530 --> 00:19:01,380
How many years has it been since someone
was able to tell us apart?

328
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:02,780
I'm ecstatic!

329
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:05,830
Can you tell their faces and
voices are different?

330
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:07,290
No, not at all...

331
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:11,800
You see, the one Kurapika and I
beat up is the husband.

332
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:14,290
Which one are you talking about?

333
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:16,800
Allow us to introduce ourselves.

334
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:19,190
We are the Navigators.

335
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:21,980
Our family provides support
for the Hunter Exam.

336
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:23,260
I'm their daughter!

337
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:24,300
I'm their son!

338
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:27,330
Man, you had us fooled.

339
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:30,480
The Hunter Exam changes site every year.

340
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:34,380
It's quite difficult to locate it.

341
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:39,600
So we Navigators help by guiding
the applicants to the site.

342
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,570
Oh, that's how it works.

343
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:45,330
But we don't help every candidate.

344
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:49,300
We test applicants to see if they're qualified

345
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:52,080
to take the exam.

346
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,590
Kurapika-dono.

347
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:54,840
Yes.

348
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:58,990
You successfully used the most vague of hints

349
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:02,860
to determine that we weren't spouses.

350
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:07,010
The hint was these tattoos
which, in this region,

351
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:10,600
mark a woman as single for life.

352
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:14,580
Kurapika-dono demonstrated that
he is very knowledgeable.

353
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:17,260
Therefore, he passes.

354
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:20,130
Way to go, Kurapika.

355
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:20,940
Thanks.

356
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:22,380
Leorio-dono.

357
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:23,320
Yeah...

358
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:27,580
You never realized my true identity.

359
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,630
However, you dressed my injuries

360
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:33,020
faster and more thoroughly than any doctor.

361
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:37,250
Most importantly, you continued
to reassure me

362
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:41,010
that my wife was safe.

363
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:42,690
S-Stop it...

364
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:43,830
It's embarrassing...

365
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:48,850
Your kindness makes you worthy
to take the Hunter Exam.

366
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:51,350
Thus, you pass.

367
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:52,970
R-Really?

368
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:56,560
Thank goodness...

369
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:57,780
You did it!

370
00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:02,370
And finally, Gon-dono.

371
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:03,240
Yes!

372
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:08,740
Your superhuman physical ability
and powers of observation

373
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:12,500
make you worthy to take the Hunter Exam.

374
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,750
You pass.

375
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:26,800
We will now take you to the exam site.

376
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:31,020
Isn't it great that we all passed?

377
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:32,880
It's too early to celebrate.

378
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,380
We've merely earned the right
to take the real exam.

379
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:36,950
What's wrong with celebrating a little?

380
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:39,330
We're making progress.

381
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:42,170
Honestly, you people really should think.

382
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:44,780
Hey! Why must you be such a smart-ass?

383
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:46,670
Stop moving around!

384
00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:48,780
If you fall, blame yourself!

385
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:54,270
Gon and his friends enjoy a brief
journey through the sky.

386
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:59,990
However, they still haven't reached
the starting line.

387
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:32,620
Next time: Rivals x For x Survival.

388
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:34,100
I'm going to do my best!

388
00:23:35,305 --> 00:24:35,851
