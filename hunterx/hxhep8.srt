1
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:07,960
Fearsome monsters... Exotic creatures...

2
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,530
Vast riches... Hidden treasures...

3
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:18,530
Evil enclaves... Unexplored lands...

4
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:23,250
The word "unknown" holds magic.

5
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:27,080
And some incredible people are
drawn to that magic.

6
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:29,290
They are known...

7
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:35,010
...as Hunters!

9
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,160
One more!

10
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:14,190
You just used your right hand!

11
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:19,010
I did it!

12
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:21,940
Hooray...

13
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Decision x By x Majority?

14
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:35,880
Dawn breaks,

15
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:38,050
as the airship carrying Gon and his friends

16
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:40,000
approaches its destination.

17
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:44,380
The Third Phase of the Hunter Exam
is about to begin.

18
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:52,270
I apologize for the long wait.

19
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:56,280
The airship will soon arrive
at its destination.

20
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,030
Wow!

21
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:00,880
Is that where the next test will be held?

22
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,050
What is this place?

23
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:07,540
There's nothing here.

24
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:09,040
Ahem...

25
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:12,790
Everyone, the exam's Third Phase
will begin here,

26
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,410
at the top of Trick Tower.

27
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:18,050
Trick Tower?

28
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:19,680
To pass this phase,

29
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,530
you must reach the tower's base alive.

30
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:26,560
The time limit is seventy-two hours.

31
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:30,310
With that, we will now begin
the Third Phase.

32
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:33,090
I will pray for your success.

33
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:32,670
No way.

34
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:41,280
So it's finally my turn?

35
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:55,800
Best of luck to everyone!

36
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:03,030
Are we supposed to climb down?

37
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:05,160
That would be suicide...

38
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:08,430
Maybe for a normal person.

39
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:17,130
But a top-class rock climber can
handle this, no problem.

40
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:19,220
Wow...

41
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:21,690
He's going down pretty fast.

42
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:27,680
Looks like I'll be the first one
to pass the Third Phase...

43
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,920
Stop! Stay away!

44
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:45,500
Stop! Stop it!

45
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:49,230
Help!

46
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:56,320
G-Guess we can't climb down the side...

47
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:58,510
Yeah.

48
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:16,250
What's up?

49
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:17,980
There are fewer people around.

50
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:19,000
What?

51
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:21,430
I count twenty-three,

52
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:24,730
which suggests almost half of the
applicants have already found an exit.

53
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:28,510
No way. When did they do that?

54
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:30,660
That means there must be

55
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:34,580
some hidden doors that lead below.

56
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:37,300
Kurapika! Leorio!

57
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,320
What is it, Gon?

58
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,280
Look. I found a hidden door.

59
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:47,490
I see now.

60
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:50,800
So we can descend by flipping the stones.

61
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,800
Okay!

62
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,950
Great job, Gon!

63
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:54,540
Let's head on down!

64
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:57,000
But I'm confused.

65
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,290
About what?

66
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:02,710
There are also hidden doors here,
there, over there,

67
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:05,670
and over there, as well.

68
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:07,160
That many?

69
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:11,180
Five hidden doors,
located in the same area.

70
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:13,100
It sounds suspicious to me.

71
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,310
Some could be traps.

72
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:16,990
And it looks as though

73
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:19,670
each door can only be used once...

74
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:21,060
Seriously?

75
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:26,240
We tried opening a door
someone else used,

76
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,720
but it wouldn't budge.

77
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:31,080
Judging by the door's size,

78
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:33,810
only one can fit at a time.

79
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:37,220
In other words, only one person
can use each door.

80
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:40,580
We'll have to split up.

81
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:44,740
Gon and I decided that we're each
going to choose a door.

82
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:46,970
No hard feelings if one
of us springs a trap!

83
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:49,090
What are you guys gonna do?

84
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:50,310
I can live with that.

85
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:52,720
Luck is part of the game...

86
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,500
I have no objection.

87
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,100
Then that settles it.

88
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:02,670
Let's go, on the count of three.

89
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:05,610
I guess this is goodbye for now.

90
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:07,860
We'll meet up again, at the tower's base.

91
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,430
Let's go...

92
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:10,490
One!

93
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:11,740
Two!

94
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:12,740
Three!

95
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:23,290
Huh?

96
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,180
Huh? What?

97
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:33,940
That was quite a brief farewell.

98
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:35,150
Oh,

99
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:39,570
so all the doors led to the same room...

100
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,320
"The five of you

101
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:54,070
must follow the will of the majority
to reach the goal."

102
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:55,400
Five of us?

103
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:58,330
Look... There are five stopwatches.

104
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:01,330
There's an O and an X button.

105
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:06,590
Could it be that we won't be
able to leave this room

106
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,580
until another person drops in?

107
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:11,860
That is correct!

108
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:12,720
Who's that?!

109
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,040
My name is Lippo.

110
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,550
I am the prison warden here,

111
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:19,180
as well as the Third Phase examiner.

112
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:21,060
Prison warden?

113
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:25,560
Multiple routes through this tower
have been prepared.

114
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:28,940
You have chosen the path
of majority rule.

115
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:30,680
Cooperation will be key

116
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:34,450
if you wish to clear this
phase of the exam.

117
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:38,920
One person's selfish behavior
can derail an entire group.

118
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:42,800
And you can't start until you
have five members.

119
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:45,830
Best of luck, gentlemen!

120
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:52,070
We can't move on until
someone else arrives?

121
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:53,570
What do we do?

122
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:56,130
We have to wait, I guess...

123
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,070
Did you need something, warden?

124
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:15,260
The test begins now.

125
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:17,570
Take your assigned positions.

126
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:19,560
Okay.

127
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:30,040
Oh, come on!

128
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:32,960
It's been two hours...

129
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:36,970
What if the others all took
different routes?

130
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:40,720
Only a fool would still be at
the top of the tower!

131
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,510
Calm down, Leorio.

132
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:43,970
Complaining won't help.

133
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:45,080
But...

134
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:48,480
What if no one shows up before
we reach our time limit?

135
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:49,710
Hey!

136
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,640
I can't just sit here and...

137
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,070
Quiet!

138
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:54,020
Huh?

139
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:55,990
That sound...

140
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,750
Good grief...

141
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,360
Tonpa-san.

142
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,770
Oh.

143
00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:18,460
It's the old man.

144
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:22,850
Okay!

145
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:30,610
I see.

146
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:32,850
So the door appears

147
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:35,030
once five people arrive and
put on the stopwatches.

148
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:39,530
"At this door, select
O to open, X not to open."

149
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:41,970
Forcing us to use majority rule already?

150
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:44,540
The answer should be obvious...

151
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:47,790
What?

152
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:51,250
Who pushed the X button?

153
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:54,000
Sorry, that was me.

154
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,550
I pressed the wrong button
by mistake.

155
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:58,640
Stop screwing around, old man!

156
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,680
Are you blind?

157
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,900
Like I said, it was an accident.

158
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:05,870
How can you accidentally press
the wrong button?!

159
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:08,010
It doesn't matter.

160
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:09,980
The door opened.

161
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:11,600
No, it does matter!

162
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,820
This guy deliberately pressed
the wrong button...

163
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:15,680
Let's go.

164
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,510
We don't have time to bicker.

165
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,000
That's right...

166
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,180
Even if he keeps pressing
the wrong one,

167
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:24,870
the rest of us just need to
press the right one.

168
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:28,610
Fine.

169
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:31,390
Okay, let's go!

170
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:33,440
Damn...

171
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,010
Seriously...

172
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:38,840
Another question so soon?

173
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,600
"Which way do you want to go?

174
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,340
O for right. X for left."

175
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:46,640
Right...

176
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:50,100
Or left...

177
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,100
Huh?!

178
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:56,700
Wh-Why would you choose to go right?

179
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,860
Normally, you should go left...

180
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:00,260
That is true.

181
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:05,030
Studies have indicated that people
who are lost or stuck at forks

182
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:08,240
unconsciously tend to go left.

183
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,620
I've heard that before, too.

184
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:14,200
Wait! The numbers don't add up!

185
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,380
Which button did you press?

186
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:17,300
Right.

187
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:18,480
Right.

188
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:21,380
Y-You guys...

189
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:23,740
That's why they chose to go right...

190
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:26,270
To outfox the examiner.

191
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:29,170
If the examiner knows that
people tend to go left,

192
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:31,890
the left path will be more difficult.

193
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:37,900
So we're just simple-minded!

194
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:39,000
We?

195
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:54,180
Wh-What is this place?

196
00:12:57,970 --> 00:12:59,670
Look over there.

197
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:05,980
The applicants have arrived.

198
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:07,930
Remove the shackles.

199
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:13,740
Jeez...

200
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:24,220
I'm finally free.

201
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:41,170
Hunter Vocabulary

202
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,170
Tonpa

203
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:47,430
Allow me to explain, gentlemen.

204
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:53,680
Before you are some of
Trick Tower's prisoners.

205
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,180
Prisoners?

206
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:58,330
The Hunter Exam Committee

207
00:13:58,330 --> 00:14:02,140
has also officially hired them
as examiners.

208
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:06,890
You will be fighting against
the five of them.

209
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:09,470
The fights will be one-on-one.

210
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:11,850
Each person may only fight once.

211
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:14,410
You are free to use any method you like.

212
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:16,080
There will be no draws.

213
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:19,020
A win is declared when the
opponent admits defeat.

214
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:23,970
You may pick your order.

215
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:25,960
It's majority rule.

216
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:29,470
So secure three wins, and you may pass.

217
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:32,030
The rules are simple.

218
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:32,770
Tsk...

219
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:34,820
Majority rule again?

220
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:37,480
Well, I prefer straightforward rules.

221
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:41,230
However, the actual fights will
not be quite so simple.

222
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:44,230
The prisoners' sentences will be reduced

223
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:48,420
by one year, for every hour they
delay the applicants here.

224
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:53,250
In other words, their goal
is also to buy time.

225
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:55,500
I understand...

226
00:14:55,500 --> 00:15:01,250
And we must reach the goal
within seventy-two hours.

227
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:05,270
So time will be critical during these fights.

228
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:12,300
Okay, I'm up first.

229
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:13,760
Bendot
199-year sentence, robbery and murder

230
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:13,760
Choose your combatant!

231
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,250
What should we do?

232
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:17,420
He said that we can fight
with any method.

233
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:20,020
So that means anything goes.

234
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:23,270
We don't know what they'll try to pull...

235
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:25,650
There's too much at stake without knowing

236
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:27,750
what they have up their sleeves.

237
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:28,900
Given that, I shall...

238
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:30,400
No, I'll go!

239
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:33,340
Tonpa-san?

240
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:35,650
I'll act as a guinea pig,

241
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:38,240
so we can discover what they're up to.

242
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,410
Consider this an apology for before.

243
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:42,790
Hey, are you serious?

244
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:43,850
Sure.

245
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:48,300
Plus, you guys don't actually
trust me, right?

246
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:54,730
Do you really want me to be the tiebreaker,
when the score is 2-2?

247
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:56,930
You have a point...

248
00:15:56,930 --> 00:15:59,430
Then it's settled.

249
00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:02,190
Tonpa, you're...

250
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:28,300
Th-That was a surprise...

251
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:30,490
I didn't expect Tonpa to volunteer.

252
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:33,720
He called himself a guinea pig.

253
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:36,510
Will Tonpa-san be okay?

254
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:42,980
Now, let us determine the
method of combat.

255
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:46,230
I propose a death match.

256
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:48,660
A death match?

257
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:51,310
They fight until one dies?

258
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:52,490
No...

259
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:55,010
Don't let him provoke you!

260
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,240
Well?

261
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,940
Very well...

262
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:02,250
I accept!

263
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:03,330
Huh?

264
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:04,750
Seriously?

265
00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:07,500
I commend you for your courage!

266
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:38,690
T-Tonpa...

267
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:41,910
Let the fight begin!

268
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,340
I...

269
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:53,840
I give!

270
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:54,700
Huh?

271
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:56,690
What?

272
00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:04,750
Did he just give up?

273
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:08,150
M-Maybe he meant "Give me a sec"?

274
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:11,440
What did you just say?

275
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:15,060
You win if I admit defeat, right?

276
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:15,990
I give up...

277
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:17,300
I lose!

278
00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:21,450
Wha... Wha... Wha...

279
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,310
All right...

280
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:30,710
I win this round.

281
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:36,220
If we win two more rounds, you lose.

282
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:39,680
You won't be able to advance or turn back.

283
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:45,240
You'll be stuck here until the
seventy-two hours are up.

284
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,510
Should that come to pass,

285
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:51,230
our sentences will be reduced
by seventy-two years.

286
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:56,420
Man, that was a disgrace.

287
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:59,240
He looked a lot stronger up close...

288
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,490
Bastard...

289
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:03,740
You just confirmed all my suspicions!

290
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:07,080
You're a worthless piece of trash,

291
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,250
who's only good for sabotaging
other applicants!

292
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:11,040
Exactly.

293
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:13,260
That's what I do every year.

294
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:16,390
And I plan to continue the tradition.

295
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:18,010
Wh-What?

296
00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:22,470
I'm not looking to pass the Hunter Exam.

297
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:24,010
I'm only in it for the thrills.

298
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:25,880
The thrills?

299
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,020
Yes.

300
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:30,920
The Hunter Exam is a trial meant

301
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,530
to crush confident young people's dreams.

302
00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:37,690
The moment of despair,
when ambition and hope give way,

303
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:42,660
gives me a sense of exquisite pleasure.

304
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:49,250
Especially when I'm actively
shattering these rookies' dreams.

305
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:54,050
I don't plan on becoming a Hunter.

306
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:57,130
I've already had enough fun this year.

307
00:19:57,550 --> 00:20:00,880
It's time for me to bow out.

308
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:02,280
You bastard...

309
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,390
Stop, Leorio!

310
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:04,490
But...

311
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:10,140
They want us to waste our time,
fighting amongst ourselves.

312
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,150
However,

313
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:16,350
if their goal is to buy time,

314
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:19,260
then the old man made
the correct choice.

315
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:20,400
Huh?

316
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:22,370
That bald guy is probably

317
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:24,910
a former soldier or mercenary.

318
00:20:24,910 --> 00:20:26,580
Had you fought him,

319
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:28,890
he would have started by
crushing your throat,

320
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:31,410
so you couldn't have given up.

321
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:34,760
Then he would have tortured you,
without killing you,

322
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,960
for the rest of the remaining time...

323
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:40,810
Th-That was one of the possibilities
I took into consideration...

324
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:43,180
You look sick.

325
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:46,210
My plan was disrupted.

326
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:50,910
I was going to take my time,
punishing him...

327
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:53,140
Don't worry. Everything will be fine.

328
00:20:56,210 --> 00:21:00,670
Sedokan
149-year sentence, serial bombings

329
00:20:57,370 --> 00:20:59,850
If we defeat two of the remaining four,

330
00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:01,390
then we win.

331
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:07,620
Regardless, we need to win
three rounds and advance.

332
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:09,200
Who's going next?

333
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,950
Me! I'll go!

334
00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:14,930
Are you sure?

335
00:21:14,930 --> 00:21:16,210
Uh-huh!

336
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:20,210
The next opponent doesn't
look too strong.

337
00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:22,840
But you can't let your guard down.

338
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:25,940
He's still a criminal.

339
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:27,660
Uh-huh, I know.

340
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:35,260
Tonpa's actions

341
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:38,540
have placed Gon and his friends
at a disadvantage.

342
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:40,460
What is their next opponent,

343
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:45,740
Sedokan, planning to do in this match?

344
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:50,330
At the start of the Hunter Exam's Third Phase,

345
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:52,170
there were 40 applicants.

346
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:54,540
With 1 eliminated,

347
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:57,210
only 39 remain.

348
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:30,590
Next time: Beware x Of x Prisoners.

349
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:32,560
And watch your back!

350
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,290
Be careful when you're out late.

350
00:23:35,305 --> 00:24:35,851
