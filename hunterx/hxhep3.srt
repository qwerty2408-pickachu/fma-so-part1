1
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:07,960
Fearsome monsters... Exotic creatures...

2
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,570
Vast riches... Hidden treasures...

3
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:18,280
Evil enclaves... Unexplored lands...

4
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:23,230
The word "unknown" holds magic.

5
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:27,080
And some incredible people are
drawn to that magic.

6
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:29,590
They are known...

7
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:35,010
...as Hunters!

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,074
-== [ www.OpenSubtitles.org ] ==-

9
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,550
We will now take you to the exam site.

10
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:05,060
Isn't it great that we all passed?

11
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:07,020
It's too early to celebrate.

12
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:09,730
We've merely earned the right
to take the real exam.

13
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:11,120
What's wrong with celebrating a little?

14
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,320
We're making progress.

15
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:18,320
Rivals x For x Survival

16
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:25,720
Zaban City

17
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:26,670
Gon and his new friends have arrived in Zaban City,

18
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:28,330
site of the Hunter Exam,

19
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:31,330
aided by the Kiriko Navigators.

20
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:36,090
As Navigators, our job is to identify
worthy Hunter applicants

21
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:39,090
and guide them to the exam site.

22
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:44,110
In other words, it would be extremely
difficult for someone to reach the site

23
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:45,970
without a Navigator's help.

24
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:48,100
Hey, wanna try one?

25
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:51,350
It's Zaban's famous panda-frog-on-a-stick!

26
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:53,230
A true delicacy!

27
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:56,980
This brooch was excavated from
Zaban's underground palace.

28
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:58,760
I bet that it's a national treasure.

29
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:03,620
You know, Zaban City is quite a shady place.

30
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:09,250
Prosperous cities tend to attract
all sorts of nasty types.

31
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,490
What are you doing, Gon?

32
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:19,260
We're going!

33
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:20,580
Yeah!

34
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,980
I believe

35
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,480
that is the building.

36
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,860
Huh?

37
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:40,720
It's so tall!

38
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,860
They have a really nice building.

39
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:45,990
So this is the exam site...

40
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:51,000
This is what draws...

41
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:54,750
Hunter applicants from across the world.

42
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:59,210
My first shot at the Hunter Exam...

43
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:02,040
Was this how Dad felt, when he first arrived?

44
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:03,760
Hey, guys!

45
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,800
Hmm?

46
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,990
Over here.

47
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:06,640
What?

48
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:08,640
Here.

49
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,080
Wait, this isn't funny.

50
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,810
Isn't that an ordinary restaurant?

51
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:21,280
You can't possibly mean that Hunter
applicants from around the world

52
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:24,060
are meant to assemble here?

53
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:25,520
I do.

54
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,280
Huh?

55
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:30,030
No one would ever expect the Hunter Exam,

56
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:33,730
with its millions of candidates,
to be located here, right?

57
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:35,060
That's true.

58
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:40,730
Welcome!

59
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:42,550
Is the back room open?

60
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:44,420
What will you have?

61
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:48,100
The steak combo that opens
your eyes to the light.

62
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:49,300
For three.

63
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,720
For three...

64
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,170
How would you like them?

65
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:57,440
Grilled over a low flame, until cooked.

66
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,210
Got it. Let yourself into the back room.

67
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:06,810
Wait here.

68
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:08,050
Wait?

69
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:09,520
Where are the others?

70
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,460
I can't wait for the steak combo.

71
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:16,710
Gon, that was just the password
to get us inside.

72
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:20,010
Oh, we don't get to eat?

73
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:22,100
One in every ten thousand...

74
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:22,710
Hmm?

75
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:27,090
The number of applicants
who make it this far.

76
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:31,000
You've done extremely well for first-timers.

77
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,720
Well, good luck.

78
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,130
Thanks!

79
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:45,070
I would be happy to serve as your
Navigator next year, as well.

80
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:50,740
What?

81
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:55,660
It appears this room is an elevator.

82
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:02,000
Bastard...

83
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,260
That meant that he expects us
to fail this year.

84
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:08,330
Once every three years.

85
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:09,260
What's that?

86
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:11,920
The frequency with which a
rookie passes the exam.

87
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:12,990
Huh?

88
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:14,770
It's that unusual?

89
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,680
Some cannot endure

90
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,220
the exam's physical and mental strain.

91
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:22,250
It's also not unusual for veterans

92
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:26,150
to break the rookies,
who consequently never retake the test.

93
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:30,910
So I guess candidates are willing to risk
everything to become Hunters.

94
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:33,830
But of course, my friend!

95
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:38,360
Hunters make the most money in this world!

96
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:39,580
No!

97
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:43,670
Hunters are the most noble in this world.

98
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,750
Glory hog...

99
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:47,450
Money grubber!

100
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,940
Gon! Listen...

101
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:55,560
Every year, over fifty Hunters

102
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:59,940
make the list of the world's
hundred richest people!

103
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:06,980
Hunters are associated with
hunting wild game and treasure,

104
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:08,280
but they are all second-rate.

105
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:13,530
True Hunters work to protect
people and the natural order.

106
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:15,110
Now, look here...

107
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:17,980
Once you're a Hunter, most countries
will give you a free pass!

108
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:19,410
And no charge to use public facilities.

109
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,600
How are those benefits?

110
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:26,990
Hunters have many difficult and
important responsibilities,

111
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:30,070
such as preserving cultural artifacts
and endangered species,

112
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:32,590
as well as capturing wanted criminals
and unscrupulous Hunters.

113
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:34,120
The fame and money...

114
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,180
That's why people wish to become Hunters!

115
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:38,730
Profound knowledge, a healthy mind and body,

116
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:39,930
and unyielding conviction...

117
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:41,940
Those are the qualities on which
Hunters pride themselves!

118
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:46,330
Gon! What do you think?

119
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:48,730
Which kind of Hunter do you
hope to become?!

120
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:51,950
Well, when you put it that way...

121
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:55,980
I think we've arrived.

122
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:57,960
We'll continue this later.

123
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:16,100
Strange atmosphere down here.

124
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:19,270
They clearly differ from the
Hunter applicants we saw

125
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:20,720
at the port and in the city.

126
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:25,850
Each is a master, in their own right...

127
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:27,550
Excuse me...

128
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,110
Everyone's really tense.

129
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:38,250
Hello. Please take a number.

130
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:41,120
Here you go.

131
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:43,870
Here.

132
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:47,660
Be sure you wear this on
your chest at all times.

133
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:49,760
Be careful not to lose it.

134
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,630
Haven't seen you guys around before.

135
00:08:57,710 --> 00:08:58,640
Yo.

136
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:01,680
You can tell we're new?

137
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,890
More or less.

138
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:09,730
After all, this will be my thirty-fifth attempt.

139
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:12,110
Thirty-five times?!

140
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:15,360
Well, you could say I'm an exam veteran.

141
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:17,920
That isn't something to brag about.

142
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,870
Indeed.

143
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:23,380
If you have any questions,
feel free to ask me.

144
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:24,530
Thank you.

145
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:26,290
My name is Tonpa.

146
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:27,370
I'm Gon.

147
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:30,400
These are Kurapika and Leorio.

148
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:34,050
Hey, are there others who

149
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:37,380
have taken the exam a bunch
of times like you?

150
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:40,580
Well, I have the most experience here,

151
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,250
but there are a few others.

152
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:43,970
For instance, there's him...

153
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:46,280
Number 255,

154
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,980
Todo, the wrestler.

155
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:50,570
He's unmatched in strength.

156
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:52,230
And he's smarter than he looks.

157
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:54,680
On the other side, we have number 103,

158
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,320
Bourbon, the snake charmer.

159
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,530
He tends to hold grudges,

160
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:00,680
so you don't want to end up on his bad side.

161
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,000
And then...

162
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:05,460
Number 191, Bodoro,
the kung fu master.

163
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:09,000
He's getting old, but there still isn't
a better martial artist around.

164
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:13,510
Then you have the three brothers,
Amori, Imori, and Umori.

165
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:15,090
They perform consistently well,

166
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:17,010
thanks to their excellent teamwork.

167
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:22,080
And number 384, Gerreta,
the huntsman.

168
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,510
He specializes in killing

169
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:26,020
all manner of creatures,
by blow dart and club.

170
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,130
There are many more,

171
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:29,980
but they have taken the test
the most times.

172
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:31,020
Ah...

173
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:57,650
Oh, how peculiar...

174
00:10:57,650 --> 00:11:00,930
His arms seem to have become flower petals.

175
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:04,430
No smoke and mirrors here.

176
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:09,300
Do take care.

177
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:12,440
When you bump into someone,
you really should apologize.

178
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:18,260
That psychopath is back again.

179
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,450
Again?

180
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:22,450
Does that mean he took last year's exam?

181
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,950
Number 44. Hisoka, the magician.

182
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:29,760
Last year, he was a virtual
lock to pass the test,

183
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,500
until he all but killed an examiner he didn't like.

184
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:37,870
A-And they're still allowing him to
retake the exam this year?

185
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:39,490
Of course.

186
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:42,600
Every year, the examiners and
test content change,

187
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45,260
and the examiners are the ones
who choose the new content.

188
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:51,660
The devil himself could pass if that were
the examiners' determination.

189
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:53,760
That's just how the Hunter Exam works.

190
00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:58,100
Anyway, no one likes him.

191
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:59,530
You should stay away, too.

192
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:03,530
He looks dangerous.
That much is for sure.

193
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:06,030
Oh, right...

194
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:08,390
A little something to mark our acquaintance.

195
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:09,720
How about it?

196
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:12,290
Oh, appreciated.

197
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:16,790
As it happened, I was thirsty...

198
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:18,200
Thanks!

199
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,250
Thank you.

200
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:20,990
There he goes.

201
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,540
He always plays the nice guy,

202
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:25,990
despite being nastier than
anyone else here.

203
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:27,960
Tonpa, the rookie crusher...

204
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:32,270
Best of luck to all of us!

205
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:43,030
The juice I gave you contains an
extremely strong laxative.

206
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:45,640
One sip, and for three days,

207
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,290
your guts will be a non-stop roller coaster.

208
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:53,630
You'll need diapers to take the exam.

209
00:12:57,060 --> 00:13:07,140
Hunter Vocabulary

210
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:07,140
Leorio

211
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:20,170
Tonpa-san, this juice must have expired.

212
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:21,250
It tastes funny.

213
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:23,830
Seriously?

214
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:25,200
That was close!

215
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:28,820
H-Huh? That's strange...

216
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:30,720
Impossible!

217
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,830
That laxative should have
practically no taste nor scent.

218
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:38,610
I'm very sorry!

219
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:40,960
I didn't realize the juice had gone bad.

220
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,840
It's okay. You don't have to apologize.

221
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:46,050
Is your stomach okay?

222
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:48,470
Y-Yes... I'm fine.

223
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:53,270
I've sampled all kinds of mountain
grasses and plants.

224
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:56,230
So I can usually taste when something's bad.

225
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:58,650
R-Really?

226
00:13:58,650 --> 00:14:00,480
That's amazing...

227
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:04,740
Damn... I had to run into
this wild mountain kid.

228
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:07,490
Sorry about that again.

229
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:09,190
I'll see you around.

230
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:11,740
Talkative old man...

231
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:17,000
Still, there's something wrong
with this year's rookies.

232
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:20,790
That number 294, Hanzo, too.

233
00:14:21,770 --> 00:14:26,030
He seemed gullible when I approached him.

234
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:28,600
Don't tell anyone else,

235
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,730
but I'm actually a ninja.

236
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:31,550
Huh?

237
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:32,800
Oh, really?

238
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,790
I seek the legendary scroll... Shh...

239
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:41,520
The Ultimate Ninja Scroll.
That is why I desire to become a Hunter.

240
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:44,750
I've heard that it's hidden somewhere

241
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:47,530
inaccessible to ordinary people.

242
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:51,020
Anyway, it's boring here...

243
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:54,070
Yeah, I guess... So, how about it?

244
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:55,540
Let's toast our new friendship.

245
00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:00,500
As a ninja, I make it a point

246
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:04,130
to never drink anything someone else offers.

247
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:06,450
Sorry.

248
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:09,420
I-I see...

249
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:15,970
I could tell by his eyes that he's no fool.

250
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:18,140
One false step, and I could've
been in real danger.

251
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:24,650
Speaking of danger, there's number 301...

252
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:30,150
That guy just oozes peril.
I can't even go near him.

253
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:33,410
Then there's that guy I can't stand,

254
00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:37,410
number 187, Nicolas.

255
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:42,920
Must've been tough to make it here.

256
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:47,420
Not really. Everything went
as predicted by my data...

257
00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:49,910
I used historical data,

258
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:52,930
from past Hunter Exams,
to calculate this year's location.

259
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:55,310
Quite simple.

260
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:57,100
Frankly, I was bored senseless.

261
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:00,860
R-Really... That's amazing.

262
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:03,400
My name is Tonpa. Nice to meet you.

263
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,050
Tonpa-san, is it?

264
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,610
Oh, there you are.

265
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,830
This is your thirty-fifth attempt,

266
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:13,360
the second-highest number by one person.

267
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:18,570
And with thirty, you have the most
consecutive appearances.

268
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:20,100
Very impressive.

269
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:22,180
Please, it's no big deal.

270
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:24,920
How about it?
Let's drink to our new friendship...

271
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:30,130
But you have yet to actually pass the exam.

272
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:32,920
I assume that's because

273
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:35,540
you're too absorbed by your other objective.

274
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:36,140
Eh?

275
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:39,140
Tonpa-san, the rookie crusher.

276
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:40,800
What?

277
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:47,780
Well, I won't share my knowledge
with anyone else,

278
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:51,220
seeing as you hold the consecutive
appearance record...

279
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:52,610
Goodbye.

280
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:02,410
Bastard... Just you wait.

281
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:06,300
I'll break that snotty nose of yours.

282
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:09,250
Hey, Tonpa-san!

283
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:12,430
Could I have more of that juice?

284
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:14,960
Must be my nerves.

285
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,180
I'm really thirsty.

286
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:17,470
Eh?

287
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:19,140
Oh, sure...

288
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,170
What the hell?

289
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:24,770
The laxative he drank earlier should
have taken effect by now.

290
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:28,270
What's going on?

291
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:36,690
It's only a laxative,

292
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:41,270
but if he imbibes that much,
he could die of dehydration.

293
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:43,290
Worried?

294
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:47,670
I'll be fine. I've trained.

295
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,080
Poisons won't affect me.

296
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:55,170
Poisons?

297
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:59,810
He knew what was in the juice?

298
00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:03,300
But he still drank it?

299
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:06,690
Number 99, Killua.

300
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:12,070
This year's rookies are all insane...

301
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:15,430
Well, it doesn't matter.

302
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:18,830
That just means crushing them will
be all the more worthwhile.

303
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:52,340
I apologize for the wait.

304
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:58,360
The entry period for
Hunter applicants has ended.

305
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:03,870
The Hunter Exam will now begin!

306
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:12,170
A final caution.

307
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:15,360
If you are short on luck or ability,

308
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:19,680
you could very well end up

309
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:23,180
seriously injured or even dead.

310
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:28,930
Those who accept the risks,
please follow me.

311
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:35,340
Otherwise, please exit via
the elevator behind you.

312
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:46,760
Very well.

313
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:51,060
All 404 applicants will participate in Phase One.

314
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,930
Of course, no one turned around and left.

315
00:20:12,930 --> 00:20:15,360
I'd hoped a few might withdraw.

316
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,180
Wh-What?

317
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:31,580
The people in front started running.

318
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:33,870
He's picked up the pace.

319
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:35,990
I neglected to introduce myself.

320
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:40,880
I am Satotz, the Phase One examiner.

321
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:45,890
I shall lead you to the exam's Second Phase.

322
00:20:46,290 --> 00:20:47,390
Second Phase?

323
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:48,890
What about Phase One?

324
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:52,020
It has already commenced.

325
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,100
It's already begun?

326
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:56,020
This is part of the test?

327
00:20:57,020 --> 00:21:00,950
You must follow me to Phase Two.

328
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:03,320
This is the exam's First Phase.

329
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:06,320
Follow you? That's it?

330
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:07,700
Yes.

331
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:11,330
I cannot tell you where or
when you must arrive.

332
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:14,330
You need to follow me.

333
00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:19,390
I see how it is.

334
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:21,180
This test is weird.

335
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:24,090
I expect it's an endurance test.

336
00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:26,280
Fine by me.

337
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:28,350
I'll be right behind you!

338
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:33,490
But there is the mental stress
of not knowing

339
00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:35,850
how far we'll have to run.

340
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:39,860
He's also testing our mental fortitude.

341
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:44,360
The exam's First Phase begins,

342
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,900
amidst a mix of warriors and knaves.

343
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:51,550
One candidate is disqualified
before it even starts.

344
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:57,790
The total number of Hunter
applicants is 404.

345
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:31,560
Next time: Hope x And x Ambition.

346
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:33,210
Time to go fishin'!

347
00:23:33,210 --> 00:23:33,920
Yeah!

347
00:23:34,305 --> 00:24:34,358
