2
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:28,240
Fearsome monsters... Exotic creatures...

3
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:33,000
Vast riches... Hidden treasures...

4
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:38,740
Evil enclaves... Unexplored lands...

5
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:43,250
The word "unknown" holds magic.

6
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:47,130
And some incredible people are
drawn to that magic.

7
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:49,580
They are known...

8
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,280
...as Hunters!

9
00:01:55,020 --> 00:02:00,020
Departure x And x Friends

10
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:04,520
Whale Island

11
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:24,880
Gon's still trying to catch the Lord of the Lake?

12
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:25,840
Huh?

13
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:28,520
Y-Yes...

14
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:32,220
He's been at it for a week, non-stop.

15
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:36,700
You promised he could take the Hunter Exam
if he caught the Lord of the Lake?

16
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:37,510
What a fool!

17
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:40,980
Five adults couldn't manage to
reel in that monster.

18
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:43,550
How is a child supposed to catch that beast?

19
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:47,230
Mito-san doesn't want him
taking the Hunter Exam.

20
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:51,790
But Gon's old man was the same age
when he caught it...

21
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:53,880
He can't do it.

22
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:17,170
Got him!

23
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:18,140
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

24
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:20,170
I got him good!

25
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:58,690
It's huge!

26
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:00,580
This is the Lord of the Lake?

27
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:02,070
It's been twenty years!

28
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:05,360
I know! It was Gon's father that time, right?

29
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,050
He's his father's son.

30
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:10,940
Gon actually caught the Lord!

31
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:12,060
Look, Mito-san!

32
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:18,630
Mito-san!

33
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:21,200
I caught the Lord, as promised...

34
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:24,240
So I can take the Hunter Exam, right?

35
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:25,700
Right?

36
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:35,700
I'll do my best.

37
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:37,710
I promise to become a Hunter!

38
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:49,790
It must be in the blood...

39
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:52,780
No one has been able to catch the Lord

40
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:56,000
after Ging pulled it off, at the age of twelve.

41
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,980
And now his son has accomplished
the same feat, at the same age.

42
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:08,010
His eyes have the same shine as his father's.

43
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:13,940
We can no longer stop him.

44
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,700
Are you sure about this, Gon?

45
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:20,720
Uh-huh.

46
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:25,950
Your father abandoned you
when you were still young

47
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,730
to become a Hunter.

48
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:29,950
I know.

49
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:32,590
He chose becoming a Hunter over raising you!

50
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:34,940
Isn't that amazing?

51
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:35,740
Huh?

52
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,480
Being a Hunter is so great, he was willing

53
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:40,880
to abandon his own kid!

54
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:43,850
It's a dangerous job!

55
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:46,880
You never know when you might lose your life!

56
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,370
Don't you understand?

57
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,860
I don't.

58
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:53,390
But I want to know more!

59
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,390
I want to become a Hunter and discover why

60
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:58,550
it was so important to my dad!

61
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:11,050
You really are Ging's son...

62
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:24,460
I promise I'll pass the exam.

63
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:27,520
I'll pass the exam, and I'll become a Hunter!

64
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,520
Just promise that you'll come back safe.

65
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,530
Can you do that?

66
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:36,070
Uh-huh, I promise!

67
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:40,540
Pinky swear made...

68
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:45,520
Whoever breaks their promise has
to swallow a thousand needles.

69
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:56,940
Sealed with a kiss!

70
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,040
Gon...

71
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:08,780
Thank you, Mito-san.

72
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:31,320
Good luck!

73
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:35,740
Knock 'em dead!

74
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:47,570
I'm going to become the
best Hunter in the world!

75
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:53,890
Once I'm the best Hunter
in the world, I'll come back!

76
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,700
The best Hunter in the world?

77
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:04,580
Kid doesn't respect us.

78
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:10,690
Every year, there are millions of skilled
applicants for the Hunter Exam.

79
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:13,100
But only a handful are selected.

80
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:17,210
Don't say stuff that you can't back up, boy.

81
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,610
What are you doing, Katsuo?

82
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:33,620
At this rate, you'll never make a decent sailor.

83
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:42,310
Why are you bent over?

84
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:43,890
Hey, losers!

85
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,510
Don't slack off!

86
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:47,900
A-Aye, sir!

87
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:50,900
Hey...

88
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,330
Didn't you hear me?

89
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:54,540
Move that box!

90
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:55,920
A-Aye, Captain!

91
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,140
Hold on.

92
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,540
Thanks!

93
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:12,550
A storm's coming.

94
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:15,940
How can you tell, boy?

95
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:18,120
That's what the seagulls are saying.

96
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,230
What?

97
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:20,160
Plus...

98
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:37,680
It's a huge storm that's coming!

99
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:39,680
It's true...

100
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:42,190
I can tell by the smell!

101
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:45,190
That boy...

102
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:52,010
Those eyes...

103
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:54,200
Could he be...

104
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,480
Captain!

105
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:16,040
The mast won't last much longer!

106
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,540
We should lower the sails!

107
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:19,010
Don't be stupid!

108
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:22,520
The fun's about to start.

109
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:28,730
Here we go!

110
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,500
Full to port!

111
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:40,670
Let's fly!

112
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:55,990
Hunter Vocabulary

113
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:55,990
Gon

114
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:07,140
Those waves weren't much...

115
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:09,260
Hey, take the helm.

116
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:10,570
A-Aye!

117
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:17,250
Damn, this is one lousy crew.

118
00:11:20,530 --> 00:11:22,420
Not a one of them can stand.

119
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:24,220
Pathetic.

120
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:27,160
And they're supposed to be
taking the Hunter Examination.

121
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:29,560
What a laugh!

122
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,390
Here are some herbs.

123
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:34,320
If you chew them, you'll feel a little better.

124
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:36,670
W-Water...

125
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:38,900
It's coming, so hold on.

126
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,400
That boy...

127
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,420
This is one sour apple...

128
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,590
I see.

129
00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:02,190
There are a few tough nuts on board.

130
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:03,110
Excuse me!

131
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:05,330
H-Here is your water!

132
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:06,930
Thanks.

133
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:09,310
Now drink your fill.

134
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:25,790
Thanks. I really appreciate it, Katsuo-san.

135
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:33,720
First, tell me your names.

136
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:35,410
I'm Gon!

137
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:37,270
I'm Kurapika.

138
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:38,830
It's Leorio.

139
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:42,420
Why do you want to become Hunters?

140
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:46,080
Hey! If you're not an examiner,
you can't boss us around!

141
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:48,600
Just answer the question!

142
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,610
My dad is a Hunter.

143
00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:57,110
I left Whale Island because I want to know

144
00:12:57,430 --> 00:13:00,480
why my dad desired so much to be a Hunter.

145
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:03,330
Whale Island...

146
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:06,140
So this is Ging's son.

147
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:09,930
The day has finally come.

148
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:12,140
Hey, kid!

149
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:12,860
Huh?

150
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:15,560
You're not supposed to answer his question!

151
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,930
Why can't I tell him why I'm here?

152
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:20,310
Not a team player, huh?

153
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:22,360
I don't wish to reveal why I'm here.

154
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,770
I agree with Leorio.

155
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:25,640
What?

156
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:28,200
Hey! Aren't you younger than I am?

157
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,110
Show some respect!

158
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:32,550
It's quite simple to avoid pesky questions

159
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:35,100
by offering a plausible lie.

160
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,020
Hey! Are you listening to me?

161
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:40,720
However, it is quite shameful to rely upon deceit.

162
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,990
That said, if I were to tell you the truth,

163
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:49,300
I would be exposing my deepest secrets.

164
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:52,230
That is why I cannot provide an answer.

165
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:54,440
Hey, you... Don't ignore me!

166
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:58,420
In other words,
you refuse to answer my question.

167
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:00,720
Hey, Katsuo.

168
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,810
Aye, Captain.

169
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:06,820
Tell the examination board that
we have two more dropouts.

170
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:09,820
What do you mean?

171
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:12,050
You still haven't figured it out?

172
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:15,320
The Hunter Examination has already begun.

173
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,540
What?

174
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:24,510
There are as many Hunter wannabes

175
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:26,900
as there are stars in the sky.

176
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:32,710
The examiners don't have the time or
resources to review them all.

177
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:38,720
So they hire people like us, to trim the fat.

178
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,560
I've already notified the board

179
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:45,090
that everyone else on this ship had to withdraw.

180
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:48,620
If they couldn't handle a little storm,

181
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:52,360
they'd stand no chance in the
Hunter Examination's later stages.

182
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:59,430
In other words, you only proceed to
the main exam if I pass you.

183
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:04,730
So think carefully before you answer my question.

184
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:07,220
So he says...

185
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:12,120
Should have told us sooner.

186
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:16,890
I am the last survivor of the Kurta Clan.

187
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:24,260
Four years ago, my clan was annihilated
by a band of criminals.

188
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:27,370
I wish to become a Hunter and
hunt down that band,

189
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:28,900
the Phantom Troupe.

190
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,880
So you want to become a bounty hunter?

191
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:36,410
The Phantom Troupe is a Class-A bounty.

192
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:40,640
Not even the most grizzled Hunters
can touch them.

193
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:43,480
You'd be throwing away your life.

194
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:46,760
I do not fear death.

195
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:50,790
I fear only that my rage

196
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,200
will fade over time.

197
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:58,810
So, in other words, you want revenge.

198
00:15:58,810 --> 00:16:02,800
Does that require that you become a Hunter?

199
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:07,020
That may be the stupidest question
I've ever heard, Leorio.

200
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:08,540
That's Leorio-san to you!

201
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:11,540
Places accessible only to Hunters...

202
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:13,010
Information otherwise unobtainable...

203
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:14,670
Actions otherwise impossible...

204
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:19,200
There are more reasons than your
brain could possibly handle.

205
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:21,050
Hey!

206
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:25,150
Why do you want to become a Hunter, Leorio-san?

207
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:27,000
Me?

208
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:29,280
I'll make it short.

209
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:31,420
I want money.

210
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:35,830
Money can get you everything!

211
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:37,330
A big house!

212
00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:38,840
A nice car!

213
00:16:39,610 --> 00:16:41,340
Good liquor!

214
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:46,420
You can't buy class with money, Leorio.

215
00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:52,980
That's three times now.

216
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,210
Step outside.

217
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:59,330
I'll end the filthy Kurta bloodline, here and now.

218
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:01,420
Take that back, Leorio!

219
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:07,390
Take that back!

220
00:17:10,590 --> 00:17:12,010
That's Leorio-san to you.

221
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:17,590
Hey, boys!

222
00:17:17,590 --> 00:17:19,820
I'm not finished yet!

223
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:20,930
Just let them go.

224
00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:21,510
Huh?

225
00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:25,850
Mito-san once told me...

226
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:29,740
If you want to get to know someone,

227
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:31,750
you need to make an effort

228
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:34,060
to learn why they're angry.

229
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:39,900
It's important for them to
understand why they're mad.

230
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:43,390
So we should let them settle it themselves.

231
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:48,220
Captain!

232
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:51,270
L-Look...

233
00:17:56,860 --> 00:18:00,670
If we get caught by that waterspout,
the ship will sink.

234
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:02,420
Lower the sails now.

235
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:03,070
Aye!

236
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:04,430
I'll help!

237
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:06,170
Uh-huh, come with me.

238
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:07,990
I'll take the helm.

239
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:08,660
Aye!

240
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:11,160
Full to starboard!

241
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:14,230
Hurry!

242
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:18,190
The waterspout is gonna catch us!

243
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:40,620
Take back what you said!

244
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:43,690
Take back your words,
and I'll forgive you, Leorio.

245
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:46,210
How many times must I repeat myself?

246
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:47,940
You should show me some respect.

247
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:50,330
I won't back down.

248
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:53,050
Then I have no choice...

249
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,320
Katsuo-san!

250
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:18,230
Damn it!

251
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:33,810
Pull 'em out! Now...

252
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,140
You idiot!

253
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:53,980
If we hadn't grabbed your legs,

254
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:56,670
you'd be shark bait now.

255
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:58,120
Honestly...

256
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:00,030
How reckless can you be?

257
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:02,180
But you did catch me.

258
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:03,070
Huh?

259
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:06,910
You both caught me!

260
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:09,750
Well, I guess so...

261
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:11,200
Gon!

262
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:16,230
Katsuo-san!

263
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:18,660
Thanks, Gon!

264
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:20,440
You saved my life.

265
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,610
I couldn't have done it alone.

266
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:25,930
These two helped save you.

267
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:26,830
Huh?

268
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,200
Thank you very much!

269
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:33,070
No, you don't need to thank me.

270
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:35,140
Well...

271
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:38,070
Yeah, I'm glad you're okay.

272
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:42,370
Yeah! So I'll be returning to my station!

273
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:48,080
What?

274
00:20:48,610 --> 00:20:51,060
I apologize for my rude behavior.

275
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:54,090
Sorry, Leorio-san.

276
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:57,130
Wh-What's with the sudden change?

277
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:58,620
We sound like strangers...

278
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:01,100
Just call me Leorio... Leorio works.

279
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:04,500
I'm also sorry.

280
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:08,420
I take back everything I said.

281
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:10,340
I was wrong.

282
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:12,430
No, it's okay.

283
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:20,250
I like you guys!

284
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:21,750
Okay!

285
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,630
I'll take responsibility for bringing

286
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:28,550
you three to the port closest to the exam site.

287
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,490
Really?

288
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:32,780
What about your test?

289
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,890
Like I said...

290
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:38,320
It's my decision to make.

291
00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:42,010
And all three of you pass!

292
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:48,620
Yay!

293
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:54,590
And so began Gon's journey...

294
00:21:55,050 --> 00:21:59,190
To follow in his father's footsteps
and become a Hunter.

295
00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:32,620
Next time: Test x Of x Tests.

296
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:33,720
Look forward to it!
