1
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:07,960
Fearsome monsters... Exotic creatures...

2
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,480
Vast riches... Hidden treasures...

3
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:18,530
Evil enclaves... Unexplored lands...

4
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:23,250
The word "unknown" holds magic.

5
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:27,080
And some incredible people are
drawn to that magic.

6
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:29,290
They are known...

7
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:35,010
...as Hunters!

Now!

10
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:08,390
Now you've experienced the joy
of discovering

11
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:11,020
how good something can taste.

12
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:14,270
We're risking our lives for that joy.

13
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:21,530
Showdown x On The x Airship

14
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:29,560
After clearing the exam's Second Phase,

15
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:32,710
Gon and his friends fly through the starry sky,

16
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:35,050
toward the site for the Third Phase.

17
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:41,300
Allow me to introduce myself to the
forty-two remaining applicants.

18
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:48,220
I am Netero, Chairman of this year's
Hunter Exam Selection Committee.

19
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:49,810
I am his secretary, Beans.

20
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:54,860
Originally, I'd planned to
make my appearance

21
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:58,070
during the exam's final phase,
but as I'm already here...

22
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:08,290
I'm loving this tension in the air!

23
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:12,290
So I think I'll stick around for
the rest of the trip.

24
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:16,500
We are scheduled to arrive

25
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:19,130
at our destination
tomorrow morning, at 8 AM.

26
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:22,260
You'll find dinner waiting in the dining hall.

27
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:24,800
You are also welcome to get some rest.

28
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:26,950
In other words,

29
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:29,810
you're free to do as you please
until you are contacted.

30
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:33,200
Okay, Gon! Let's explore the airship!

31
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,420
Yeah!

32
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:36,510
How can they have so much energy?

33
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:39,000
I'm hitting the sack.

34
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,320
You can say that again.

35
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:44,570
However, I do have one concern...

36
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:46,420
Hmm? What's up?

37
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:49,350
How many more phases are there?

38
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:49,980
Oh...

39
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:52,080
They've never mentioned that,
have they?

40
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:55,710
On average, there are five to six phases.

41
00:03:56,390 --> 00:04:00,050
Which means we still have
three or four to go...

42
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:03,890
All the more reason to rest now.

43
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,470
But you should be careful.

44
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:08,970
Huh?

45
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:13,550
The secretary only told us when
we'll arrive at our destination.

46
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:16,100
It's possible that the third exam could

47
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:18,940
take place on this airship itself.

48
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:22,610
And it doesn't necessarily mean we'll
be contacted at 8 AM.

49
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:24,630
Huh? Are you serious?

50
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:26,700
Hmm, that does make sense...

51
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:31,580
You might wake up to discover that
the exam has already ended.

52
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:35,330
If you plan to make it to the next phase,

53
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:37,840
don't let yourself relax on this airship.

54
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,200
What the hell...

55
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,060
Well, that was some good advice.

56
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:43,240
Thanks.

57
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,090
We shall bear that in mind.

58
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:47,330
Let's all do our best.

59
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:50,650
Yeah, right...

60
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:53,560
Here's hoping that you're
both nervous wrecks,

61
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,100
come the morning.

62
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:01,110
There's no chance that the next phase
will be held on the airship.

63
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:04,190
Were that their intention,

64
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:07,600
they wouldn't have said that we were
free to do as we pleased.

65
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,700
They would have told us to stand by.

66
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:20,290
Hey, how many applicants
do you expect to make it?

67
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:22,190
You mean pass the exam?

68
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:25,920
Yep. This year, we have
an impressive group.

69
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:28,970
Though I did fail them all at one point...

70
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:30,590
But doesn't it depend

71
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:33,160
on what the upcoming phases consist of?

72
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,730
That's true...

73
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:38,310
But didn't you notice it?

74
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:41,070
One of them had this whole
aura thing going on.

75
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:43,230
What do you think, Satotz?

76
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,680
Oh, yes.

77
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:49,240
I like the rookies this year.

78
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:51,230
Ha! So you agree?

79
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:54,730
I think #294 has a good shot.

80
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:58,360
I'm partial to #99.

81
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:01,300
He looks like a selfish, spoiled brat.

82
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:02,280
What do you think, Buhara?

83
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:04,900
Well...

84
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:08,010
He isn't a rookie,
but #44 is the one I favor.

85
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:11,800
I'm sure you noticed,

86
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:15,220
but when #255 was throwing a fit,

87
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:21,650
it was #44 who was really on the verge
of killing someone.

88
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:24,200
I did notice that, of course.

89
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:27,530
He could barely restrain himself
from tearing off our heads.

90
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:30,320
But didn't you realize?

91
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,850
He was already that way

92
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:36,120
from the first moment we appeared.

93
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,160
Really?

94
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:41,400
Yeah, that's the real reason
I was so edgy.

95
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,670
He kept challenging me.

96
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,470
I had a similar experience.

97
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:50,180
He should be carefully monitored.

98
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:53,260
Though it pains me to admit this,

99
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:56,050
we are birds of a feather with him.

100
00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:02,060
However, his affinity
for darkness is far stronger.

101
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:09,670
As Hunters, we are continually
seeking out rivals.

102
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:13,350
Ultimately, the Hunter Exam

103
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:17,040
is but a place to find opponents
worthy of respect.

104
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:22,240
And every once in a while, we encounter

105
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:25,360
someone who hits the floor running,

106
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,170
when we try to slow things down.

107
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,710
An oddball of sorts.

108
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,010
Hey, there! Kids!

109
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:10,890
Stay out of the kitchen!

110
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:12,660
Go eat in the dining hall!

111
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,660
Wow, awesome!

112
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:19,530
Look, Gon!

113
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:20,770
Hmm? What is it?

114
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:22,770
Whoa!

115
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:24,830
It's like the ground is covered in jewels!

116
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:25,770
Yeah!

117
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:30,090
Hey, I was wondering...

118
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:31,880
Hmm?

119
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:36,880
Where are your mom and dad?

120
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:39,840
Hmm... They're alive.

121
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:40,680
Probably.

122
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,360
What do they do?

123
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,790
They're assassins.

124
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,290
Huh? Both of them?

125
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:49,980
That's your first reaction?

126
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:53,120
You really are a riot!

127
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,050
Huh?

128
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:59,630
You're the first person who's
ever responded seriously.

129
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:01,560
Well, you're telling the truth, right?

130
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:03,560
What makes you think that?

131
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:05,530
It's just a hunch.

132
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:07,470
That's weird...

133
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:09,810
People only like me

134
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:11,960
because they can't ever tell
whether I'm serious.

135
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:17,420
I'm from a family of assassins.

136
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:18,860
So they're all assassins.

137
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:22,150
And my family has

138
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:24,360
really high hopes for me...

139
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,650
But I can't stand it.

140
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:31,090
Who wants to have their life
planned out for them?

141
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:34,030
When I told them I wanted to
decide my own future,

142
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:36,400
they all snapped!

143
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,720
My mother had tears

144
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:40,410
streaming down her face, as she told me

145
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:42,520
I have the potential to be a top assassin.

146
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,920
Horrible parents, right?

147
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,550
It's natural their kid would go bad.

148
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:48,070
We ended up fighting.

149
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:49,560
So I stabbed my mother in the face,

150
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,020
my brother in the side,

151
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:52,630
and ran away from home.

152
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:54,850
I'm sure they're out for blood now.

153
00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:56,540
But if they find me,
I'll send them packing.

154
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:59,060
When I become a Hunter,

155
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:01,620
I'll start by capturing my family.

156
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:05,580
I'm sure they're worth some
hefty bounties...

157
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:18,720
Something wrong?

158
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,560
Ah, Netero-san...

159
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,730
Did you see anyone

160
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:31,510
coming from that side?

161
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:32,730
No.

162
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,230
When did he...

163
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:37,810
You're pretty fast for an old man.

164
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:39,540
That little trick?

165
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:41,490
I barely moved.

166
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:47,020
What do you want?

167
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:48,710
You don't have to do anything

168
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:50,250
until the last phase, right?

169
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:52,940
No need to be so unkind.

170
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:56,510
I got bored, and was looking
for some companions.

171
00:10:57,450 --> 00:11:00,160
By the way, I meant to ask
the two of you...

172
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,010
Any thoughts on your first attempt
at the Hunter Examination?

173
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:05,240
Uh-huh! It's fun!

174
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:09,300
And there haven't been any of the
written exams I was dreading.

175
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:12,130
I'm disappointed...

176
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:14,760
I expected the exam to be
far more difficult.

177
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:19,030
I assume the next phase will
be more entertaining?

178
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:21,030
Well, now...
I wouldn't know about that.

179
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:23,630
Let's go, Gon!

180
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:25,430
Now wait just a moment.

181
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:29,040
Would you care to play a game with me?

182
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:32,290
A game?

183
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:37,800
If you're able to defeat me,
I shall let you be Hunters!

184
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,050
Really? I'll play!

185
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:46,190
How about it, eh?

186
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:57,150
Hunter Vocabulary

187
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:57,150
Netero

188
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,810
Now, I'll go over the rules of the game.

189
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:11,090
If you can take this ball from me,

190
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:15,250
before the airship reaches
its destination, you win.

191
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:19,760
I believe that we're scheduled
for an 8 AM arrival?

192
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:24,030
Well, that still gives you nine hours.

193
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:26,760
You're free to attack me
however you'd like.

194
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:29,450
I won't touch you.

195
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:31,810
Huh? That's too easy.

196
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:33,390
You can't call that a game.

197
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,400
Why not give it a try first?

198
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,400
We just have to take the ball?

199
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,400
Yeah.

200
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:42,650
Then I'll go first.

201
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,660
Go ahead.

202
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:51,410
He's looking down on me.

203
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:08,430
I see lots of Killuas!

204
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:13,430
This is an assassination technique.

205
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:15,690
Rhythm Echo...

206
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:20,240
Practitioners use a certain rhythm
to create after-images,

207
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,190
confusing the enemy.

208
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:28,130
I am astonished that such a young child

209
00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:30,200
has already mastered that technique.

210
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:53,850
Damn, he keeps darting around.

211
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:55,100
Is he really an old man?

212
00:13:55,490 --> 00:13:57,860
What? That's it?

213
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:01,370
In that case,

214
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:03,730
I'll stop his movement!

215
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,740
Ouch... Right on his pivot leg!

216
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:18,520
Ow!

217
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:22,630
He didn't hold back with that kick.

218
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:26,260
If I were an ordinary person,
that would have shattered my leg.

219
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,190
Damn...

220
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:30,890
His legs are hard as iron...

221
00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:31,990
Killua!

222
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:33,150
Tag! Tag!

223
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:34,520
It's my turn!

224
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:40,970
What will this kid try?

225
00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:43,400
He appears to be a very honest boy.

226
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:45,150
Okay!

227
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:56,220
Oh... He has a quick first step.

228
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,060
But he'd need another ten years

229
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:00,290
before attacking me head-on.

230
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:02,210
I guess he is just a child.

231
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,450
Huh? From above?

232
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:09,580
Ow!

233
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:10,340
Idiot!

234
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:12,990
We know that you can jump
really high!

235
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:15,170
Control your strength!

236
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:17,720
For a moment, the old man
relaxed his guard!

237
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,350
No kidding...

238
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:27,860
He may appear simple-minded,
but he clearly uses his head.

239
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,610
I messed up there.

240
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:34,120
They should keep me entertained
until the morning.

241
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:49,630
Those two were pretty shaken.

242
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:52,590
I bet they're too nervous

243
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:55,320
to get a wink of sleep...

244
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,140
They're sound asleep?

245
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:15,150
You boys aren't getting anywhere.

246
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:17,760
Why not attack simultaneously?

247
00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:19,700
Why, you...

248
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:22,460
Okay... I'll get you this time!

249
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,290
Here they come.

250
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:35,550
Netero-san hasn't even broken a sweat.

251
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:39,350
Ow!

252
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,940
So we can't beat him
without subterfuge.

253
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:51,150
Your attacks are getting boring.

254
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:59,080
He kicked off his shoe to
increase his range?

255
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:04,710
A chance!

256
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,010
I think not.

257
00:17:11,370 --> 00:17:13,090
You and your little tricks!

258
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:16,770
It's mine!

259
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:36,860
I commend you on your efforts.

260
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:40,870
You're amazing, Netero-san!

261
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:42,230
Really amazing!

262
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:51,870
Forget it...

263
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:52,790
I give up.

264
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:54,130
I lose!

265
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:54,820
Huh?

266
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:56,880
Oh? He's quitting?

267
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,890
Why? We still have time.

268
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:02,890
And just now, we came really close.

269
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:07,390
Jeez. You really have no clue, do you?

270
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:12,470
The old man has barely used his
right hand and his left leg.

271
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:13,030
What?

272
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,820
But we're still powerless against him.

273
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:18,200
We could chase him around for a year,

274
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,740
and never take the ball from him.

275
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,940
Oh, you figured it out?

276
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:25,660
And here, I thought I'd fooled you.

277
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,530
So that's what he was doing.

278
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:31,020
You really know how to
piss me off, old man.

279
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:32,590
Let's go, Gon!

280
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:34,650
Oh, I'm gonna play a little longer.

281
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:35,170
Huh?

282
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:37,910
Didn't you hear what I said?!

283
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:38,620
It's useless!

284
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:40,920
You won't be able to take
the ball from him!

285
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:43,180
Yeah! I don't care about the ball.

286
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:46,060
We've only used up half
of the time limit.

287
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:48,320
I'm gonna make Netero-san
use his right hand

288
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,560
before the time runs out.

289
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,820
I see...

290
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:56,250
Yeah, I got it.

291
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:57,450
Good luck.

292
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,710
I'm getting some sleep.

293
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:04,950
Say, Netero-san...

294
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:05,840
Hmm?

295
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,410
How did Killua do that thing
where he walked slowly,

296
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:11,400
and it looked like there were
a bunch of Killuas?

297
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:17,780
That technique is for those engaged
in underground work.

298
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:20,340
You have no need to learn it.

299
00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:23,380
In fact, you should not learn it.

300
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:25,400
But it's an amazing technique, right?

301
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:29,540
It requires an intensive amount
of training.

302
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:32,310
Killua's really something!

303
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:36,820
You fool.

304
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:44,870
Damn it! Now I'm in a bad mood.

305
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:48,060
Well, I guess there's
nothing for it.

306
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:49,120
Hey.

307
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:49,870
Wait up, kid.

308
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:53,080
You bump into us,
and then ignore us?

309
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,300
Bastard!

310
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:01,960
If I hadn't stopped then,

311
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:06,390
I'd have ended up killing that
old man to get the ball.

312
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:18,110
Oh, he's moving faster.

313
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:21,110
Here it comes!

314
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:23,970
He'll feint for the ball,

315
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:25,620
but attack my stomach!

316
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:30,160
O-Ouch!

317
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:33,620
One more!

318
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:39,200
If he head-butts me in the stomach again,

319
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,130
he'll shatter his skull.

320
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:45,640
But if I relax my stomach,
I'll be the one suffering.

321
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:49,140
I'll run away.

322
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:55,900
Ah, is he dead?

323
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:04,410
You just used your right hand!

324
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:12,660
I did it!

325
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:16,420
Hooray...

326
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:29,860
Hello, helmsman?

327
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:32,300
It's me. Is the flight going well?

328
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:33,590
I see.

329
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:35,690
I'm sorry to ruin it for you,

330
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,930
but could you fly a little slower?

331
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:46,850
During a game Netero proposed to kill time,

332
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:49,160
he's seen something in Gon.

333
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:53,630
The airship and its 42 applicants
