Welcome to UA High,

00:00:13,263 --> 00:00:14,765
the prestigious school
that's turned out

00:00:14,806 --> 00:00:17,100
some of the world's
greatest heroes.

4
00:00:17,142 --> 00:00:19,394
I'm running toward
my dream in these halls.

5
00:00:19,436 --> 00:00:21,605
Learning to overcome
obstacles and save people

6
00:00:21,647 --> 00:00:24,024
with a smile on my face.

7
00:00:24,066 --> 00:00:27,069
That's how I'll become the
greatest hero in the world!

[VLAD]
Class A's already training.

You all need to catch up.

15
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:14,885
Last semester, Class A
was in the spotlight.

16
00:02:14,926 --> 00:02:17,137
Next semester,
it's Class B's turn.

17
00:02:17,179 --> 00:02:19,765
From now on, you're
shooting for the top.

Don't let me down!

[TETSUTETSU] We're such
disappointing students!

20
00:02:23,894 --> 00:02:26,480
I get you want everyone
to improve our Quirks.

21
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:29,191
But we have 20 unique
powers in our class.

00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:32,235
What kind of training will
help all of us get better?

[KAMAKIRI]
Yeah, can you be more specific?

24
00:02:34,655 --> 00:02:36,281
[VLAD] When your muscle
fibers are overused,

25
00:02:36,323 --> 00:02:37,991
they break and
grow back tougher.

26
00:02:38,033 --> 00:02:40,786
Thicker. Quirks are
the same way.

27
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:42,788
They improve the harder
you push them.

28
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:44,915
Stronger after every workout.

29
00:02:44,956 --> 00:02:48,377
In other words, there's
only one thing to do!

Katsuki Bakugo.

34
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:02,557
He's plunging his hands
into boiling water to expand

35
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:04,935
his sweat glands, then
creating chain explosions

36

Shoto Todoroki.

38

Alternating between
ice and fire,

39
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:13,652
he's regulating the
temperature of the water.

40
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:15,445
His body gets
accustomed to the cold

41
00:03:15,487 --> 00:03:17,656
and he works on
controlling his flames.

42
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:20,283
Some day he might be able
to use both at once!

[PRESENT MIC]
Hanta Sero.

Having him produce tape
continuously will increase

00:03:25,122 --> 00:03:27,666
his capacity and improve
the tape's tensile strength

Eijiro Kirishima
and Mashirao Ojiro.

48

Every time Ojiro hits
Kirishima's Hardened skin

49
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:36,717

In order to increase the reach

56
00:03:48,687 --> 00:03:51,022
of his Anivoice, he's
doing vocal exercises

57
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:52,899
to help him build up his range.

58
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:55,902
It's also good for helping
him to become less shy.

He's building up his body
by blasting Navel Laser.

62
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:01,908
This increases
the attack's range

63
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:04,411
and lets him use it
even with tummy issues.

to your Quirks.

Once we team up with Class A,
there'll be 40 students here.

That's a whole lot of Quirks

An important part of
saving someone recovering

Hmph. Spending your entire life

Hey, about your parents.

235
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:21,037
I was wondering.

236
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:22,705
Were they the Water Hose heroes?

237
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:24,249
With the water Quirks?

238
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:25,583
Did Mandalay tell you?

00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,418
No. It's, um...

Well... Sorry!

But...

242
00:10:30,922 --> 00:10:33,091
I heard a little about
what happened to them.

243
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:36,261
And based on that
information, I figured...

244
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:38,388
I remember reading about
that horrible incident

245
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:41,391
a few years ago.

246
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:43,309
Go away.

00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:45,311
Everyone here's so crazy.

248
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:48,481
Calling people stupid names
like "hero" and "villain,"

249
00:10:48,523 --> 00:10:50,483
and then killing each
other because of it.

250
00:10:50,525 --> 00:10:52,485
Always focusing on their Quirks.

251
00:10:52,527 --> 00:10:57,782
If they hadn't been showing off,
they'd still be here. Idiots.

00:10:57,824 --> 00:11:01,870
[IZUKU] It's not just heroes.

Huh?

00:11:19,304 --> 00:11:21,055
It's a hereditary thing.

261
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:23,558
And these days it's
really uncommon.

262
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,436
He admired heroes so much,
and wanted to be one.

263
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:28,479
Thing is, you can't
usually become a hero

264
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:30,523
unless you've got
some kinda Quirk.

But still.

My friend refused to accept
that, and hoped for a miracle.

267

He tried to use telekinesis.

And to breathe fire.
But it was no good.

There are lots
of different ways

to think about how Quirks work.

271
00:11:46,748 --> 00:11:49,042
So, we might not
be on the same page.

00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,800
[AIZAWA] Think carefully
about why you're more tired

318
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:05,011
than the others before
you start whining.

319
00:14:05,053 --> 00:14:06,721
You have much to improve here.

320
00:14:06,763 --> 00:14:08,306
[STUDENTS]
Right. Yes, sir.

321
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:10,099
[AIZAWA]
Uraraka! Aoyama!

322
00:14:10,141 --> 00:14:11,434
The same goes for you.

323
00:14:11,476 --> 00:14:14,103
Your team didn't fail,
but you were very close.

324
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:16,314
I'd say you passed the
proverbial finish line

325
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:17,231
by only a hair.

326
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:18,733
[OCHACO yelps]
That bad?

327
00:14:18,775 --> 00:14:20,318
<i>Mon dieu</i>.

328
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,652
[AIZAWA]
Don't lose focus.

329
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:23,654
Each of you can move faster!

330
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:24,906
And no matter what you're doing,

331
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:27,241
just remember where
you started from.

332
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:29,994
Don't forget who
you were before UA.

333
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:32,080
Always keep in mind
why you're sweating,

334
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:34,332
and why your limits
keep getting tested.

335
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:36,584
That's what it means to improve.

336
00:14:36,626 --> 00:14:38,002
[KATSUKI]
Where I started.

337
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:39,295
[TODOROKI]
Who I am.

338
00:14:39,337 --> 00:14:42,090
[IZUKU]
How I got here.

339
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:44,217
[IZUKU] Hey, that
reminds me, Mr. Aizawa.

340
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:45,843
It's already the
third day of camp.

341
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:48,388
[AIZAWA] Weren't you
listening? Stay focused.

342
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:50,348
[IZUKU] I was just
wondering if All Might‐‐

343
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:53,768
I mean, the other teachers
from UA will be joining us.

344
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:56,020
Like I said before
we came out here.

345
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:58,147
To keep the camp a secret
from the villains,

346
00:14:58,189 --> 00:14:59,899
hardly anyone knows
where we are.

347
00:14:59,941 --> 00:15:02,652
That's why you get to work out
with us four pussycats!

348
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:04,112
And think about it.

349
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:06,531
We believe All Might is one
of the League's targets,

350
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:08,199
so we can't have him here.

351
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:09,951
It's for your own safety.

352
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:10,993
For better or for worse,

353
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:13,746
that's what he gets for
standing out so much.

354
00:15:13,788 --> 00:15:14,956
Hah.

355
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:17,834
[IZUKU] Seems like it's mostly
"for worse" these days.

356
00:15:19,836 --> 00:15:21,170
[IZUKU]
So that's it.

357
00:15:21,212 --> 00:15:23,339
All Might won't be
here to help me.

358
00:15:23,381 --> 00:15:25,007
Meow, meow, meow, meow!

359
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:26,426
More importantly,

360
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:28,177
tonight's gonna be fun!

361
00:15:28,219 --> 00:15:31,055
We're pitting classes against
each other in a test of courage.

362
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:33,015
I know you've been
training hard today.

363
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:35,268
And later, you'll
get to play hard!

364
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:37,145
How's that for a reward?

365
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:38,855
[KENDO] It just sounds
like more training.

366
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:41,607
And training in
the dark, no less.

367
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:43,693
Revelry in the dark.

368
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:46,028
[RIN]
How much can we do in one day?

369
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:49,782
[laughs] 'Least we get to
beat Class A, am I right?

370
00:15:49,824 --> 00:15:51,200
Don't slack now!

371
00:15:51,242 --> 00:15:53,828
Make sure you keep on pushing
yourself as you work!

372
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:55,329
[STUDENTS]
Yes, ma'am.

373
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:57,915
Remember... where I came from.

374
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:00,793
[TIGER]
Hey. You're not Plus Ultra yet.

375
00:16:00,835 --> 00:16:02,670
[IZUKU yelps]
Right!

376
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:05,173
Whoa, Bakugo,

377
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:06,591
you're really good
with that knife!

378
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:07,467
It's weird.

379
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:08,551
What do you mean "it's weird"?

380
00:16:08,593 --> 00:16:11,179
How can you people be so
damn bad at everything?

381
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,306
[KAMINARI] Look at that.
He's not blowing stuff up.

382
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:15,516
I'm too tired for this.

383
00:16:18,853 --> 00:16:19,896
[TODOROKI]
Did you need All Might

384
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:21,647
for a particular reason?

385
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:23,608
You asked Mr. Aizawa about him.

386
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:26,444
Yeah. Um. I did.

387
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:27,778
Because of Kota.

388
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,405
Kota? Who's that?

389
00:16:29,447 --> 00:16:32,074
[IZUKU]
Huh? The boy that's over there.

390
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:34,911
He's Mandalay's cousin's...

391
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:38,289
Hold on. Where did he go?

392
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:40,333
[IZUKU]
Probably to his hideout.

393
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:44,629
He really doesn't like
being around everyone.

394
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:47,298
[IZUKU] Anyway, Kota
doesn't like heroes.

395
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:50,134
Actually, he hates the whole
concept of superhumans,

396
00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:51,802
Quirks and everything.

397
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:56,307
I tried to talk to him, but I
think I just made things worse.

398
00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:58,226
I was just wondering what
All Might would have done

399
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:00,895
to help him if he'd been here.

400
00:17:00,937 --> 00:17:03,481
I mean, what would you
say to him, Todoroki?

401
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:06,359
It depends.

402
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,985
Of course! Sorry I asked!

403
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:09,320
To have a complete stranger

404
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:11,030
try to change your
mindset sounds like

405
00:17:11,072 --> 00:17:13,157
a pretty irritating
conversation.

406
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:15,201
What matters are actions.

407
00:17:15,243 --> 00:17:18,287
You have to show him what
you're trying to prove. Right?

408
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:20,623
If you're going to
rely on words alone,

409
00:17:20,665 --> 00:17:23,167
then they'd better
be incredibly powerful.

410
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:25,378
What you say doesn't
matter near as much

411
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:28,047
as what you actually do.

412
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:29,298
[ALL MIGHT]
So when I saw this timid,

413
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:31,300
Quirkless boy try
to save a life,

414
00:17:31,342 --> 00:17:33,511
it inspired me to act, too.

415
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:37,139
Young man. You, too,
can become a hero.

416
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:42,562
You're right. I went
about this the wrong way.

417
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:45,273
How can I, a stranger,
say anything to him?

418
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:48,276
I don't know what your goal is
when it comes to this child.

419
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:50,069
But it sounds to me
like you shouldn't be

420
00:17:50,111 --> 00:17:52,780
sticking your nose in
a delicate situation.

421
00:17:52,822 --> 00:17:55,783
You tend to cut to the heart
of people's feelings.

422
00:17:55,825 --> 00:17:57,618
It can be annoying.

423
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:59,829
[IZUKU]
Right. Sorry about that.

424
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:02,498
[TENYA] You guys!
Your hands aren't moving!

425
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:05,001
We'll never make the best
stew if you stop now.

426
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:09,005
[PIXIE‐BOB]
Perfect.

427
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:11,257
We've filled our bellies
and cleaned the dishes.

428
00:18:11,299 --> 00:18:13,009
It's time for...

429
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:14,927
A totally awesome
test of courage!

430
00:18:14,969 --> 00:18:16,721
[KIRISHIMA, SERO, KAMINARI]
We're gonna win!

431
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:17,888
[AIZAWA]
Not so fast.

432
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,016
It pains me to say it,
but the remedial class

433
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:23,102
will be having lessons
with me tonight instead.

434
00:18:23,144 --> 00:18:24,729
You've gotta be kidding me!

435
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:25,563
[AIZAWA]
Sorry.

436
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:27,481
Your training during the
day didn't impress me,

437
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:29,859
so I'll be using this time, too.

438
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,360
[KAMINARI, SERO]
Oh, give me a break!

439
00:18:31,402 --> 00:18:34,822
[SATO, KIRISHIMA]
I just wanna prove my courage!

440
00:18:34,864 --> 00:18:36,157
Okay. So.

441
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:38,868
Class B is going to start
out as our "scarers."

442
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:39,702
When they're in place,

443
00:18:39,744 --> 00:18:42,330
Class A will leave in pairs
every three minutes.

444
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:43,789
There are tags with
your names on them

445
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:45,166
at the far end of the route.

446
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:48,294
Your goal is to collect those.

447
00:18:48,336 --> 00:18:49,837
Revelry in the dark.

448
00:18:49,879 --> 00:18:51,631
[OCHACO]
Why's he keep saying that?

449
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:53,466
[PIXIE‐BOB] Now, those who
are scarers aren't allowed

450
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:54,800
to make physical contact.

451
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:56,761
Use your Quirks to
terrify the others.

452
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:57,345
Got it?

453
00:18:57,386 --> 00:18:59,472
The winners are
the creative students

454
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:01,724
who make the most people
piss their pants.

455
00:19:01,766 --> 00:19:03,392
Did we need that visual?

456
00:19:03,434 --> 00:19:04,352
I see!

457
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:06,479
They're encouraging us
stoke our imaginations

458
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,563
as we compete with each other,

459
00:19:07,605 --> 00:19:09,523
all while showing us
more uses for our Quirks

460
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:10,650
in the process.

461
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:12,276
As expected of UA!

462
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:13,152
All right!

463
00:19:13,194 --> 00:19:15,821
Everyone draw to see
who your partner will be.

464
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:18,157
[IZUKU] Hm? If we're
in teams of two...

465
00:19:18,199 --> 00:19:19,158
Wait.

466
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,911
There are 20 of us,
but five in extra lessons.

467
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:27,375
[IZUKU] One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight?

468
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:28,751
Okay let's try this again,

469
00:19:28,793 --> 00:19:30,211
I must be missing something.

470
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:33,297
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight?

471
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:35,716
[IZUKU yelps]
I'm all alone.

472
00:19:35,758 --> 00:19:37,259
We were randomly assigned.

473
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:40,721
It's not that nobody
chose you or anything.

474
00:19:40,763 --> 00:19:42,598
Listen up, Tail.

475
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,142
‐‐Trade with me.
‐‐[MINETA] Aoyama.

476
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:47,436
[MINETA] Please switch me
partners, I should be with her!

477
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,772
Wait, what did you call me?

478
00:19:49,814 --> 00:19:51,941
Revelry in the dark.

479
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:54,193
[JIRO, HAGAKURE scream]

480
00:19:54,235 --> 00:19:55,695
[PIXIE‐BOB]
Next team!

481
00:19:55,736 --> 00:20:00,074
That's you two kittens.
Ribbity and Miss Floater.

482
00:20:00,116 --> 00:20:01,784
[JIRO, HAGAKURE screaming]

483
00:20:01,826 --> 00:20:03,703
[OCHACO]
I'm getting scared, Tsu.

484
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:05,538
And those screams
aren't helping.

485
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:08,040
[TSUYU]
That's Kyoka and Toru, I think.

486
00:20:08,082 --> 00:20:09,709
Here, take my hand.

487
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,043
Don't be afraid.

488
00:20:11,085 --> 00:20:15,172
We'll look out for each other.
One step at a time.

489
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:16,716
[OCHACO]
Mm‐hm.

490
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:21,512
[HONENUKI laughs]
Nice going, Kodai,

491
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:23,514
you managed to scare
everybody so far,

492
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:24,557
ya big creeper!

493
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:26,100
[KENDO] Yeah, you're
the star of the night!

494
00:20:26,142 --> 00:20:26,934
[KODAI]
Huh?

495
00:20:26,976 --> 00:20:31,355
I can't get over how funny
Bakugo and Todoroki were.

496
00:20:32,815 --> 00:20:33,691
[KATSUKI, TODOROKI]
Oh.

497
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:34,525
Oh.

498
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:35,776
Oh.

499
00:20:35,818 --> 00:20:38,028
I thought they were tough.

500
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,114
[KENDO]
Hey. Smell that?

501
00:20:40,156 --> 00:20:42,032
I think there's
something burning nearby.

502
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:44,618
[HONENUKI]
Huh? Now that you mention it,

503
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,912
it's kinda smoky out here.

504
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:51,208
Maybe Bakugo and Todoroki
got so scared, they fire‐‐

505
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,043
Honenuki?

506
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:54,420
[gasps]

507
00:20:54,462 --> 00:20:57,256
[KENDO]
Yui! Don't breathe in!

508
00:20:57,298 --> 00:20:59,717
This smoke. It's poisonous!

509
00:21:01,844 --> 00:21:03,971
[PIXIE‐BOB] What's this
foul smell in the air?

510
00:21:04,013 --> 00:21:05,306
[IZUKU]
You see that?

511
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:06,223
[MANDALAY]
Black smoke.

512
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:08,309
[TENYA]
Has something been set ablaze?

513
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:10,269
[OJIRO]
Maybe a fire on the mountain?

514
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:18,402
[DABI]
Now, it begins.

515
00:21:18,444 --> 00:21:19,111
[PIXIE‐BOB]
Hey, what's happening?

516
00:21:19,153 --> 00:21:20,488
[MANDALAY]
Pixie‐Bob!

517
00:21:21,739 --> 00:21:23,365
[DABI]
Take them down.

518
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:27,286
Those who believe they
deserve the title "hero."

519
00:21:27,328 --> 00:21:29,789
[TOGA cackles]

520
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:32,625
[DABI]
We, the Vanguard Action Squad

521
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:37,963
of the League of Villains, will
tear them off their pedestals.

522
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:40,925
[MAGNE] First, let's get
rid of these feral cats.

523
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:43,219
[MINETA]
What? No way!

524
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:46,889
I thought they made sure
no one could find us.

525
00:21:46,931 --> 00:21:48,557
So why the heck
are there villains

526
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:50,184
attacking this place?

527
00:21:50,226 --> 00:21:51,477
Pixie‐Bob!

528
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:54,021
This is bad.

529
00:21:56,816 --> 00:21:59,401
[gasps] Where's Kota?

530
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:37,875
[IZUKU]
Here's the preview!

531
00:23:37,917 --> 00:23:39,376
The League of Villains
suddenly attack

532
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:40,669
during our test of courage,

533
00:23:40,711 --> 00:23:43,172
and not even Kota can escape
their evil clutches.

534
00:23:43,213 --> 00:23:44,715
To make matters worse,
I'm the only one

535
00:23:44,757 --> 00:23:46,300
who knows where he is.

536
00:23:46,342 --> 00:23:48,135
That means it's up
to me to save him.

537
00:23:48,177 --> 00:23:49,678
But I have to hurry!

538
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,680
I need to remember
why I want to be a hero

539
00:23:51,722 --> 00:23:53,265
if I'm going to succeed,

540
00:23:53,307 --> 00:23:56,185
and how far I've come
since I first met All Might.

541
00:23:56,226 --> 00:23:58,604
Next time: "My Hero."

542
00:23:58,646 --> 00:24:00,272
With One For All at full power,

543
00:24:00,314 --> 00:24:02,483
hopefully, I can protect
Kota from harm!

544
00:24:02,524 --> 00:24:04,902
Go beyond! Plus Ultra!

545
00:24:05,305 --> 00:25:05,285
