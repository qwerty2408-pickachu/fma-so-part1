Welcome to UA High.

2
00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:15,140
In a world where about 80
percent of the population

3
00:00:15,182 --> 00:00:17,434
has some kind of superpower
called a "Quirk,"

00:00:17,476 --> 00:00:19,686
this prestigious school was
built to train the heroes

5
00:00:19,728 --> 00:00:21,647
who protect our citizens.

6
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:23,273
Many of the world's
top champions

7
00:00:23,315 --> 00:00:24,483
have walked these halls.

8
00:00:24,525 --> 00:00:26,860
Now, I'm a student here.

00:00:26,902 --> 00:00:29,238
My name is Izuku Midoriya,

10
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,114
and I'm working hard
to fulfill my dream

11
00:00:31,156 --> 00:00:34,034
of being a true hero.

12
00:00:34,076 --> 00:00:35,994
I want to become someone
who saves others

13
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:38,455
with a smile on my face.

14
00:00:38,497 --> 00:00:40,165
This is the story
of how I became

15
00:00:40,207 --> 00:00:42,292
the greatest hero in the world.

and his incredible rise to f‐‐

[SHIGARAKI]
I've figured it out.

23
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:38,825
Why the Hero Killer
pisses me off so much.

24
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:42,245
And why those UA brats
drive me crazy.

25
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:43,955
It's because of All Might.

26
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:45,666
And that stupid grin,

27
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:48,001
as though he doesn't
have a care in the world.

28
00:02:48,043 --> 00:02:50,045
Smiling thoughtlessly.

29
00:02:50,087 --> 00:02:52,464
As if there's no one
he can't save.

30
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:54,883
Like he's undefeatable.

[KUROGIRI]
Izuku Midoriya.

32
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:03,975
Quirkless until middle school,

33
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:06,645
when he suddenly
manifested a power.

34
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:08,563
After enrolling at UA High,

35
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:11,316
he distinguished himself by
finishing in the top eight

36
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:14,653
at their world‐famous
sports festival.

37
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:16,947
Then, during the Hosu incident,

38
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:20,367
he and his friends fought
the Hero Killer, Stain...

39
00:03:20,409 --> 00:03:21,785
...and won.

40
00:03:21,827 --> 00:03:22,911
Afterward,

41
00:03:22,953 --> 00:03:27,040
the Hero Killer chose
to spare the child's life.

42
00:03:27,082 --> 00:03:30,293
Izuku Midoriya was
acknowledged by Stain,

43
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:33,797
the man seeking out
true heroes, as worthy.

44
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:37,759
He judged Tomura Shigaraki
quite differently.

45
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:40,721
[SHIGARAKI]
Just picture it.

A world without the
Symbol of Peace.

I'll show society
just how fragile

their sense of safety is.

00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:56,069
[IZUKU] Now that our
intense first semester

But that doesn't mean
we have time to relax.

We've got a training camp
in the woods coming up.

been ten minutes.

Yeah. Some fun before

We have to increase each of the
students' Quirks this summer.

00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:06,431
Agreed.

00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:08,266
Why don't you start
by giving me a rundown

81
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,352
of all of Class A's abilities?

If I must.

83
00:05:13,355 --> 00:05:15,232
[AIZAWA]
Let's start with Yuga Aoyama.

84
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:17,025
His Quirk is Navel Laser.

85
00:05:17,067 --> 00:05:19,986
It's... basically,
a bellybutton laser.

86
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:23,031
Then we have
Mina Ashido. Quirk: Acid.

87
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:26,243
She secretes a corrosive
substance that melts targets.

88
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:29,204
Tsuyu Asui. Her Quirk is Frog.

89
00:05:29,246 --> 00:05:32,415
And she can do pretty much
everything a frog can.

90
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:36,044
Tenya Iida is the
class rep. Quirk: Engine.

91
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:39,339
The engines in his calves
grant him super speed.

92
00:05:39,381 --> 00:05:43,176
There's Ochaco Uraraka.
Her Quirk: Zero Gravity.

93
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:45,637
She can make anything
she touches weightless.

94
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:48,890
Mashirao Ojiro. His Quirk
is called "Tail."

95
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:52,018
He can manipulate his tail
as if it were an arm or leg.

96
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:55,897
Moving on to Denki Kaminari.
Quirk: Electrification.

97
00:05:55,939 --> 00:05:58,859
He discharges built‐up
electricity from his body.

98
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,570
The spiky‐haired one
is Eijiro Kirishima.

99
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:03,113
Quirk: Hardening.

100
00:06:03,154 --> 00:06:05,407
He can make his
entire body stone‐like.

101
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:09,202
Koji Koda is the quiet type.
Though, his Quirk is Anivoice.

102
00:06:09,244 --> 00:06:11,162
He uses it to control
animals and insects,

103
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:13,039
but it can't affect humans.

104
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:16,543
Rikido Sato is strong.
Quirk: Sugar Rush.

105
00:06:16,585 --> 00:06:20,046
He turns the sugar stored
in his body into pure power.

106
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:23,508
Then we have Mezo Shoji.
His Quirk is Dupli‐Arms.

107
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:24,926
He can make other
body parts appear

108
00:06:24,968 --> 00:06:27,220
on the tips of his tentacles.

109
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:28,305
Kyoka Jiro.

110
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:30,390
Her Quirk is called
"Earphone Jack."

111
00:06:30,432 --> 00:06:32,517
Using the retractable
plugs on her earlobes,

112
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:35,103
she can distinguish between
even the quietest of sounds.

113
00:06:35,145 --> 00:06:36,897
Plus, she can use the
speakers on her legs

114
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:40,233
to release incredibly
devastating sonic bursts.

115
00:06:40,275 --> 00:06:42,652
Hanta Sero has
a Quirk named "Tape."

116
00:06:42,694 --> 00:06:43,945
It has many uses.

117
00:06:43,987 --> 00:06:45,697
He can shoot sticky
tape from his elbows

118
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:47,282
and use it to apprehend
his opponents,

119
00:06:47,324 --> 00:06:50,368
or simply to swing
around through the air.

120
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:53,914
Fumikage Tokoyami.
Quirk: Dark Shadow.

121
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:55,916
He commands a devastating
bird‐like shadow

122
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:58,293
that gets wilder when
there's no light.

123
00:06:58,335 --> 00:07:00,795
Endeavor's son, Shoto Todoroki.

124
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:02,672
His Quirk is
Half‐Cold, Half‐Hot.

125
00:07:02,714 --> 00:07:04,466
He can emit ice from the
right side of his body,

126
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:06,509
and flames from the left.

127
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:08,970
The Stealth Hero, Toru Hagakure.

128
00:07:09,012 --> 00:07:12,766
Her Quirk: Invisibility.
She's invisible.

129
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:15,352
The sports festival
winner, Katsuki Bakugo.

130
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:17,020
Quirk: Explosion.

131
00:07:17,062 --> 00:07:18,939
He sweats a
nitroglycerin‐like substance

132
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,774
and makes it blow up.

133
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:22,609
Of course, there's
Izuku Midoriya.

134
00:07:22,651 --> 00:07:24,152
His Quirk is Super Power.

135
00:07:24,194 --> 00:07:26,321
He can increase the power
and physical abilities

136
00:07:26,363 --> 00:07:29,658
of isolated appendages,
or his entire body.

137
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:33,286
[sighs] Minoru Mineta.
His Quirk: Pop Off.

138
00:07:33,328 --> 00:07:35,872
The balls he pulls off his
head can stick to anything,

139
00:07:35,914 --> 00:07:38,458
though he himself
bounces off them.

140
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,669
Finally, there's Momo Yaoyorozu.

141
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:42,212
Her Quirk is Creation.

142
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:43,880
She can create
any non‐living thing

143
00:07:43,922 --> 00:07:46,007
from the lipids in her body.

144
00:07:46,049 --> 00:07:47,217
And that's it.

145
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:50,178
We should also go over

Sorry to interrupt.

149

We were wondering about
the form we turned in

150
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:58,770
a few days ago about the pool.

151
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:01,398
[AIZAWA] Oh. The school
has granted you permission.

152

You're allowed to use
the pool until 5 pm.

to use the pool

156
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:09,489
for endurance training, correct?

00:08:09,531 --> 00:08:11,032

pool to improve our stamina.

160
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:17,372
That's a great idea, Mineta.

161
00:08:17,414 --> 00:08:19,416
Plus, if we're at school,
we can use our Quirks!

162
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:22,419
It'll be the perfect
way to train!

163
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,504
Just what you'd
expect from us heroes.

164
00:08:24,546 --> 00:08:26,214
You know what we're gonna do.

165
00:08:26,256 --> 00:08:28,258
Go beyond. Plus Ultra!

166
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:29,843
Ultra!

167
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:32,053
[KAMINARI] It was a smart
choice to invite Midoriya.

168
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:33,555
He's a great cover.

169
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:35,140
[MINETA] If it had just
been us, we wouldn't have

170
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:37,225
gotten permission to
use the pool, I bet.

171
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:38,309
[KAMINARI]
This works, and it could be

172
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:40,311
the defining moment
of our lives.

173
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:41,688
[MINETA]
Don't jinx us.

174
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:43,898
I told you what I
heard the girls say.

175
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:46,109
It was right after
the finals were over.

176
00:08:46,151 --> 00:08:47,736
Wait, so we're not
supposed to take any

177
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:49,487
long trips over summer vacation?

178
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,990
Yeah, apparently that's
what the school said.

179
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:53,491
How unfortunate.

180
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,076
I was supposed to
spend several weeks

181
00:08:55,118 --> 00:08:56,745
touring Venice with my parents.

182
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:58,204
What is your life?

183
00:08:58,246 --> 00:09:01,833
Aw, and I just bought, like,
a bajillion new swimsuits.

184
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,877
Well turns out,
that's what happens

185
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:06,046
when your class is attacked
by the League of Villains.

186
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:07,380
But I wanna <i>do</i> something!

187
00:09:07,422 --> 00:09:08,882
I don't wanna spend
my whole summer bored!

188
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:10,050
‐‐That's so dumb!
‐‐[HAGAKURE] I've got it!

189
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:11,509
Why don't we hang out
at the school pool

190
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:13,428
over summer vacation, huh?

191
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:14,637
Good idea.

192
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:16,556
I bet we can talk the
teachers into letting us

193
00:09:16,598 --> 00:09:18,475
use it if we ask them nicely.

194
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:20,977
Plus it'll be free,
so we'll save money.

195
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:23,313
That's way better than
being cooped up in my room.

196
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:24,355
Leave it to me.

197
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:27,984
I'll start working on a
formal proposal right away.

198
00:09:28,026 --> 00:09:29,611
All the girls in
their swimsuits!

199
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:32,197
[KAMINARI] It's our duty
to support our classmates.

200
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:34,074
[MINETA] Just imagine how
voluptuous the girls

201
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:36,409
are gonna be outside
of their uniforms.

202
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:37,827
[MINETA, KAMINARI]
Faster, hurry up!

203
00:09:37,869 --> 00:09:42,749
Paradise is waiting on the
other side of this door!

204
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:43,958
There you are, slowpokes.

205
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,210
[KAMINARI, MINETA yelp]

206
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:46,252
[MINETA]
No, no, no.

207
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:48,671
What the heck are
you guys doing here?

208
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:50,882
Since we're doing endurance
training at the pool,

209
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:53,218
I messaged everyone to see if
they wanted to come with us.

210
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:54,344
You did what?

211
00:09:54,385 --> 00:09:56,096
Now all our plans are ruined.

212
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:57,472
Don't lose hope yet.

213
00:09:57,514 --> 00:09:59,015
There will definitely
still be girls

214
00:09:59,057 --> 00:10:01,351
splashing around the water.

215
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:03,853
[KAMINARI] I'll burn
the sight into my brain.

216
00:10:03,895 --> 00:10:06,147
[MINETA] I can't wait
to see those skimpy suits!

217
00:10:06,189 --> 00:10:07,774
Oh, hey. Hi, Mineta.

218
00:10:07,816 --> 00:10:09,234
I didn't know you guys
would be here.

219
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:11,820
[KAMINARI] I can't believe
there's not a single bikini.

220
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:12,987
Foiled again.

221
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:15,281
You know, school suits
are still pretty hot.

222
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:16,866
[KAMINARI]
Have some standards, dude.

223
00:10:16,908 --> 00:10:18,910
[TENYA]
Kaminari. Mineta. Nice work.

224
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:20,829
I'm proud of you for
suggesting more training.

225
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:24,165
You're an asset to our class.
Let me thank you.

226
00:10:24,207 --> 00:10:25,166
[BOTH whimper]

227
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:26,835
[TENYA]
Now. Don't just sit there.

228
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:29,003
It's time to come sweat with us.

229
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:30,463
[TENYA laughs]

230

‐‐[MINETA] No, wait. Not cool!

231
00:10:32,841 --> 00:10:35,468
[KAMINARI, MINETA]
This wasn't the plan!

232
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:49,149
[OCHACO]
Get ready for it! Serve!

233
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:50,942

[HAGAKURE]
Got it!

237
00:10:55,864 --> 00:10:57,574
[YAOYOROZU]
Set!

238
00:10:57,615 --> 00:11:00,034
[TENYA] All right! Let's
take a 15‐minute breather.

239
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:03,705
I brought these for everyone.
Please, drink up!

240
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:04,664
[SATO]
Nice!

241
00:11:04,706 --> 00:11:05,874
[OJIRO]
Thanks a lot, Class Rep.

242
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:08,126
[SERO]
This is just what I needed!

243
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:12,922
[KAMINARI] Why do the girls
get to play around instead?

244
00:11:12,964 --> 00:11:14,382
[MINETA] They got permission
to use the pool,

245
00:11:14,424 --> 00:11:16,885
so they can goof off.
Can you believe it?

246
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:18,052
You idiot.

247
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:20,638
Why did you make our application
for endurance training.

248
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21,639
Sure, blame me,

249
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:24,058
I didn't hear you
making any suggestions!

250
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,685
It looks like you've
been working out.

251
00:11:25,727 --> 00:11:27,353
I'm practically
living at the gym.

252
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:29,230
It's been kinda nice, actually.

253
00:11:29,272 --> 00:11:31,232
[TOKOYAMI]
We must all remain focused.

254
00:11:31,274 --> 00:11:33,610
[panting]

255
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:35,445
[TENYA]
Hey, Midoriya.

256
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:37,113
It looks like you
could use a break.

257
00:11:37,155 --> 00:11:39,365
You're probably right, thanks.

258
00:11:43,453 --> 00:11:44,621
[IZUKU]
Something wrong?

259
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:48,625
No. This is just
funny, that's all.

260
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,210
At the entrance exams,

261
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:52,337
I couldn't imagine the
two of us would get along,

262
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:54,714
much less become
such good friends.

263
00:11:54,756 --> 00:11:56,382
I guess, if I'm being honest,

264
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:59,052
I didn't think that
much of you back then.

265
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:01,804
And yet. During the
practical exam...

[IZUKU]
Smash!

269
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:18,696
You did put Uraraka
ahead of yourself.

270
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:22,242
Even though saving her
meant you might not pass.

271
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:24,118
[ALL MIGHT] How could a
hero course reject someone

272
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,828
who is committed
to saving others,

273
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:28,831
no matter the
consequences to himself?

274
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:31,918
After all, that is
what makes a hero.

275
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:36,256
Welcome, Izuku.

276
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:37,465
You have made it.

277
00:12:37,507 --> 00:12:41,010
You're now part of
the hero academia.

278
00:12:41,052 --> 00:12:42,887
I was so happy.

279
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:44,722
It had always been a
dream of mine to attend

All Might's alma mater someday.

281
00:12:46,516 --> 00:12:48,768
Even though I knew
it was a long shot.

282
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:51,521
And then, when Mr. Aizawa
said the person

283
00:12:51,562 --> 00:12:54,148
in last place for the fitness
test would be expelled,

284
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:56,651
I was sure I'd be going home.

You may have thought that,
but you never gave up.

Oh.

You weren't perfect.

were reckless.

But I could feel the
tenacity and drive

reason Bakugo and I

lost to you in our

00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:45,453
You must build up your
body in that time.

476
00:20:48,122 --> 00:20:50,166
[ALL MIGHT]
Young Midoriya?

477
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:53,544
[IZUKU] All Might!
What are you doing here?

478
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:55,796
[ALL MIGHT]
I could ask you the same.

479
00:20:55,838 --> 00:20:57,757
[IZUKU]
I am here...

480
00:20:57,798 --> 00:21:01,552
[ALL MIGHT] Young man.
You, too, can become a hero.

481
00:21:01,594 --> 00:21:02,803
The truth is,

482
00:21:02,845 --> 00:21:05,389
there's nothing natural
about my Quirk.

483
00:21:05,431 --> 00:21:06,974
I wasn't born with this power,

484
00:21:07,016 --> 00:21:09,101
it's a sacred torch
that was passed on to me

485
00:21:09,143 --> 00:21:10,561
from someone else.

486
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:12,855
I can transfer
my Quirk to another.

487
00:21:12,897 --> 00:21:16,108
And that's only one facet
of my secret abilities.

488
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:21,197
The true name of my
power is One For All.

489
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:22,448
You're next, kid.

490
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:25,451
You are my worthy successor.

491
00:21:25,493 --> 00:21:29,371
...because this is where
my journey began.

492
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:33,584
[ALL MIGHT]
Young Midoriya,

493
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:35,878
the summer training
camp will be tough.

494
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,296
Try your hardest.

495
00:21:37,338 --> 00:21:38,464
[IZUKU]
I will!

496
00:23:08,721 --> 00:23:11,557
[VLAD] So the location of
the training camp has moved?

497
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:12,391
[AIZAWA]
Yes.

498
00:23:12,433 --> 00:23:15,853
Just in case information is
getting leaked to the villains.

499
00:23:15,895 --> 00:23:19,106
Only the upper management of UA
knows where it will be now.

500
00:23:19,148 --> 00:23:22,776
Please keep it to yourself.
Don't even tell the students.

501
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:24,111
[VLAD grunts]

502
00:23:24,153 --> 00:23:27,031
[phone ringing]

503
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:28,365
[SHIGARAKI]
There's something I'd like you

504
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:31,327
to prepare for me. That's right.

505
00:23:31,368 --> 00:23:34,872
We're about to start
playing a brand new game.

506
00:23:35,998 --> 00:23:37,374
[IZUKU]
Now, the preview!

507
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:39,668
UA High's special summer
training camp in the woods

508
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:41,337
is about to be under way!

509
00:23:41,378 --> 00:23:44,173
From what I hear, it'll include
a hellish workout regimen

510
00:23:44,214 --> 00:23:45,883
to give us first years
the push we need

511
00:23:45,925 --> 00:23:48,135
to earn our provisional
hero licenses.

512
00:23:48,177 --> 00:23:49,929
Students normally don't
even try for those

513
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:51,555
until thier second year!

514
00:23:51,597 --> 00:23:54,767
[yelps] Wait! Is that
some kind of monster?!

515
00:23:54,808 --> 00:23:55,643
Next time:

516
00:23:55,684 --> 00:23:57,811
"Wild, Wild Pussycats."

517
00:23:57,853 --> 00:23:59,355
If I'm gonna become a hero,

518
00:23:59,396 --> 00:24:01,899
then first, I'll have
to survive this summer!

519
00:24:01,941 --> 00:24:05,027
Go beyond! Plus Ultra!

520
00:24:06,305 --> 00:25:06,674
