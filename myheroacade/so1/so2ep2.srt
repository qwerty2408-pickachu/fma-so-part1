[IZUKU] Beneath our flashy
superhero society

lurks a dark underworld.

00:00:18,477 --> 00:00:21,021
Every time we've driven
the villains back,

5
00:00:21,063 --> 00:00:23,732
they've retreated to the
safety of the shadows,

00:00:23,774 --> 00:00:26,068
regaining their strength.

7
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:28,820
Waiting for the perfect

[SHIGARAKI]
The Master is good.

00:00:32,491 --> 00:00:35,452
I tried so hard to find out
where those idiots were going,

10
00:00:35,494 --> 00:00:37,704
and he figured it out
in an instant.

11
00:00:37,746 --> 00:00:39,873
Guess he really showed me up.

12
00:00:39,915 --> 00:00:41,959
[KUROGIRI] It was worth
having a team on standby,

Tomura Shigaraki.

[GIRAN] I heard back
from the union today.

00:00:51,969 --> 00:00:54,429
You can expect
a delivery tomorrow.

18
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:57,432
It was thrown together quickly,
so it might not look like much.

19
00:00:57,474 --> 00:00:59,601
But quality is guaranteed.

20
00:00:59,643 --> 00:01:01,144
[KUROGIRI]
I must apologize for making

21
00:01:01,186 --> 00:01:03,522
such an unreasonable request.

22
00:01:03,564 --> 00:01:05,440
Tell me, Shigaraki.

23
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:07,067
Do you know why
the union accepted

24
00:01:07,109 --> 00:01:10,028
this outlandish order of yours?

25

'Cause everyone's got
high expectations of you.

If the League of Villains
steps into the light,

27
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:17,953
then the scum hiding on the
sidelines will follow suit.

28
00:01:17,995 --> 00:01:21,081
And if that happens, it means
brokers like me win big.

29
00:01:21,123 --> 00:01:23,041

[SHIGARAKI]
Oh, yes.

That's how I'll become the
greatest hero in the world!

Now that you've finished up

it's time for summer vacation
to officially begin.

However...

Don't think these

for you heroes‐in‐the‐making.

At this camp,

52
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:51,231
we'll push you to
go beyond your limits.

53

You're aiming to
become "Plus Ultra!"

[IZUKU] Wow. Uraraka and
the others sure are excited.

67

I heard some of Class A
is taking extra courses.

68
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:25,974
Does that mean they actually
failed the final exams?

69
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:27,642
That must be so embarrassing.

70
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:28,977
Especially since you're
supposed to be

71
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:30,479
so much better than my class.

wallowing in shame!

It's nice to see you outside
of the sports festival.

I guess now we're not
technically rivals.

an hour before our first stop.

00:14:29,452 --> 00:14:30,286
Yeah, sure.

320
00:14:30,328 --> 00:14:31,746
[AIZAWA]
Enough playing around.

321
00:14:31,788 --> 00:14:33,790
Get your stuff off the bus.

322
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:35,208
Once your bags
are in your rooms,

323
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:36,959
we'll have dinner
in the cafeteria.

324
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:39,128
After that, you can
bathe and sleep.

325
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:41,672
Tomorrow your training
starts in earnest.

326
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:43,508
You'd better get a move on.

327
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:48,971
It looks so good!

328
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:51,599
[SERO]
So,

329
00:14:51,641 --> 00:14:54,435
you girls got stuck in a tiny
little bunk room, didn't ya?

330
00:14:54,477 --> 00:14:56,187
Why? Is the guys'
room really big?

331
00:14:56,229 --> 00:14:56,896
[ASHIDO]
Oh, yeah?

332
00:14:56,938 --> 00:14:59,232
So, like, can I come
check it out later or what?

333
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:00,858
[SERO]
Sure! Whenever you want.

334
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,277
[KIRISHIMA] It's so good.
I can't get enough!

335
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:04,946
[KAMINARI] My stomach
is so happy right now.

336
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:06,656
It's as good as
Lunch Rush's food!

337
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:08,282
I think I might eat
until I burst.

338
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:10,243
[KAMINARI gasps]
I smell beef.

339
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:11,911
Hey, wait, you got
meat over there?

340
00:15:11,953 --> 00:15:12,703
[PIXIE‐BOB]
Yeah.

341
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:16,791
Jeez, it's like you guys haven't
eaten in a week or something.

342
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:19,460
Anyway, today's the only time
we'll be doing this for you.

343
00:15:19,502 --> 00:15:20,962
So make sure you kids enjoy it.

344
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:22,547
[KAMINARI, KIRISHIMA]
Thank you!

345
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:23,673
[MANDALAY]
Hey, Kota!

346
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:25,758
Can you bring me
those vegetables?

347
00:15:36,561 --> 00:15:39,147
[MINETA] The food and stuff
is fine, but to be honest,

348
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:41,107
I'm hungry for somethin' else.

349
00:15:41,149 --> 00:15:42,859
Just one little wall.

350
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,485
A few pieces of wood.

351
00:15:44,527 --> 00:15:46,863
And heaven's waiting
on the other side.

352
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:51,367
A bath full of boobs and babes
ready to be seen by yours truly.

353
00:15:51,409 --> 00:15:52,243
[KAMINARI sighs]

354
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:55,121
Are you over there talking
to yourself again, Mineta?

355
00:15:55,163 --> 00:15:56,831
[ASHIDO]
This feels amazing!

356
00:15:56,873 --> 00:15:59,125
[JIRO] I'm so glad they've
got a hot springs here!

357
00:15:59,167 --> 00:16:02,044
Bathe, my angels.

358
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:04,255
How stupid of them not
to stagger the times

359
00:16:04,297 --> 00:16:07,550
that we'd be naked
next to each other.

360
00:16:07,592 --> 00:16:10,094
I hope they never learn
from their mistakes.

361
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:11,721
It's too much for him.

362
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:13,973
You're to stop this
at once, Mineta.

363
00:16:14,015 --> 00:16:15,349
What you're doing is demeaning.

364
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:17,185
For both the girls and yourself.

365
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:19,187
It's shameful behavior!

366
00:16:20,605 --> 00:16:23,608
Now I know why
I have this Quirk.

367
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:26,903
[MINETA] It's because walls
are meant to be climbed.

368
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:30,781
I'm coming for you,
ladies, Plus Ultra!

369
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:32,158
All that Quirk training.

370
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,035
All the times I almost died.

371
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:38,247
It was to prepare for
this shining momen‐‐!

372
00:16:38,289 --> 00:16:39,999
[KOTA]
Before you become a hero,

373
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:43,127
you should learn
how to be a good human.

374
00:16:43,169 --> 00:16:45,671
I'll get you for this!

375

00:16:49,467 --> 00:16:51,969
[TSUYU] Mineta really is
the worst, isn't he?

378
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:54,222
[ASHIDO]
Thanks so much, Kota, babe!

379
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:56,974
We owe you one!

[IZUKU]
Look out!

384
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:07,944
[MANDALAY]
The rush from the fall

385
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:11,739
likely caused him
to faint. Thank you.

386
00:17:11,781 --> 00:17:14,784
Eraser warned me one of you
boys was a little girl crazy,

387
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:17,662
so I stationed Kota
up there to keep watch.

388
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:20,915
I suppose that's the danger
of teaching kids your age.

389
00:17:20,957 --> 00:17:23,751
Well, anyway. I'm just
glad he's all right.

390
00:17:23,793 --> 00:17:26,837
You must've moved
pretty fast to catch him.

391
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:28,464
[KOTA]
The last thing I want is to hang

392
00:17:28,506 --> 00:17:31,092
with some wannabe heroes.

393
00:17:34,345 --> 00:17:38,766
[IZUKU] Um. He doesn't like
heroes very much, does he?

394
00:17:38,808 --> 00:17:40,601
I admit, that's weird to me.

395
00:17:40,643 --> 00:17:43,062
Most everyone I know
wants to be one.

396
00:17:43,104 --> 00:17:45,147
It's... my dream.

397
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:47,984
So, it's just wild to
think that a kid his age

398
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:51,737
is against heroes.
Hates them, even.

399
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:54,907
How observant. Of course,
he isn't alone.

400
00:17:54,949 --> 00:17:59,453
There are many in our society
who don't approve of us.

401
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:01,622
If he'd had a normal childhood,

402
00:18:01,664 --> 00:18:04,834
maybe he would've admired heroes
like you did growing up.

403
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:06,919
[gasps] What happened?

404
00:18:06,961 --> 00:18:09,213
[PIXIE‐BOB]
It was Mandalay's cousins.

405
00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:13,551
Kota's parents, that is.
They were heroes, too.

406
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:15,219
But they were murdered.

407
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:16,762
[gasps]

408
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:19,265
It was a villain.
Two years back.

409
00:18:19,307 --> 00:18:21,934
Kota was still so small.

410
00:18:21,976 --> 00:18:24,645
They were killed while
protecting citizens.

411
00:18:24,687 --> 00:18:28,357
Perhaps the most respectable
way for any hero to die.

412
00:18:28,399 --> 00:18:30,192
But...

413
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:33,446
[KOTA]
Papa. Mama.

414
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:37,158
[MANDALAY] How do you even
begin to explain to a child

415
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:40,578
that his parents died
honorable deaths?

416
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:44,206
They were his entire
world. Everything.

417
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:48,419
But to him, his parents
had left him behind.

418
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:50,588
And all the while,
they were being praised.

419
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:54,884
Because... their sacrefice
was such a noble one.

420
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:56,802
Honestly, he doesn't
seem to like us

421
00:18:56,844 --> 00:19:00,723
that much either. We're
heroes, like they were.

422
00:19:00,765 --> 00:19:02,433
I'm sure he feels like
he's stuck here

423
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:04,769
because he has
nowhere else to go.

424
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:08,272
Heroes just don't make
any sense to Kota.

425
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:10,733
After all, if his parents
hadn't been heroes,

426
00:19:10,775 --> 00:19:12,985
they would still be here.

427
00:19:13,027 --> 00:19:14,362
[SHIGARAKI]
He's why these morons

428
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:16,614
are able to smile thoughtlessly!

429
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:21,035
Because that garbage pro
is smiling thoughtlessly, too!

430
00:19:21,077 --> 00:19:23,204
[IZUKU] I'd heard so many
different people talking about

431
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:25,373
heroes over the last few months.

432
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:28,334
Had listened to so many
different viewpoints.

433
00:19:28,376 --> 00:19:31,545
It would be irresponsible
to shrug them off.

434
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:34,715
And yet, in that moment,
I had no reply.

[AIZAWA]
Good morning, class.

437
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:47,186
Today, we begin a training camp

438
00:19:47,228 --> 00:19:49,605
that will increase
your strength.

439
00:19:49,647 --> 00:19:52,024
Our goal is to increase
your skills exponentially,

440
00:19:52,066 --> 00:19:54,944
so that each of you earns
a provisional license.

441
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:56,696
This will allow you
to face the dangers

442
00:19:56,737 --> 00:19:59,156
that continue to fester
in the darkness.

443
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:03,452
Proceed carefully.
Look alive, Bakugo.

444
00:20:03,494 --> 00:20:05,329
Try throwing that for me.

445
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:07,998
Yeah, sure. Like in
the fitness test.

446
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,208
[AIZAWA]
That's right.

447
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:13,045
When you first started school,
your record was 705.2 meters.

448
00:20:13,087 --> 00:20:14,380
Let's see if you've improved.

449
00:20:14,422 --> 00:20:17,258
[ASHIDO] Oh, I get it!
We're checking our progress.

450
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:19,427
[SERO] A lot's happened to
us the last three months.

451
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:21,595
Maybe he can throw it
a whole mile now!

452
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:24,515
[KIRISHIMA]
C'mon, get it, Bakugo!

453
00:20:24,557 --> 00:20:28,144
I've got this. No one blink.

454
00:20:28,185 --> 00:20:30,563

[IZUKU]
"Go to hell"?

00:20:40,281 --> 00:20:42,575
[AIZAWA]
That was 709.6 meters.

457
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:43,909
[KATSUKI grunts]

458
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:47,037
[SERO]
That's it? Kinda disappointing.

459
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:51,959
[AIZAWA] You've had
a single semester at UA,

460
00:20:52,001 --> 00:20:53,586
and due to your
various experiences,

461
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:55,838
all of you have
definitely improved.

462
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,381
But those improvements
have mostly been

463
00:20:57,423 --> 00:21:00,259
limited to mental prowess
and technical skill.

464
00:21:00,301 --> 00:21:03,637
With a slight increase in
stamina thrown in along the way.

465
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,307
Your Quirks really haven't
grown that much stronger.

466
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:07,975
Not on a fundamental level.

00:22:57,751 --> 00:22:59,587
He wants us to bring
these along when we go,

474
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:02,464
so I'm guessing there's
enough for everyone.

475
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:05,509
[MUSCULAR]
C'mon. I'm ready.

476
00:23:05,551 --> 00:23:07,553
Let's hurry up and do this.

477
00:23:07,595 --> 00:23:09,430
[MUSTARD]
It's still too early.

478
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:10,890
Besides, don't forget,

479
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:13,058
he said we shouldn't
do anything flashy.

480
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,059
[DABI]
Yeah.

481
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:17,521
He acted like a spoiled
little brat when we first met.

482
00:23:17,563 --> 00:23:22,109
But suddenly, he's begun
to take charge.

483
00:23:22,151 --> 00:23:24,737
This is gonna be nothing
more than a warning shot.

484
00:23:24,778 --> 00:23:26,530
We'll pull those
false heroes down

485
00:23:26,572 --> 00:23:29,366
from their shining pedestals.

486
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:30,784
And in doing so, we'll create

487
00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:33,412
a bright new future
for this world.

488
00:23:36,206 --> 00:23:37,499
[IZUKU]
Here's the preview!

489
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:39,752
It turns out that developing
our individual Quirks

490
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:42,171
is this summer training
camp's main focus.

491
00:23:42,212 --> 00:23:44,632
To do that, we've got to
push ourselves to the limit.

492
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:47,426
It's the only way we can
hope to become pros!

493
00:23:47,468 --> 00:23:49,345
But Kota still scoffs at us.

494
00:23:49,386 --> 00:23:50,971
Even though he's part
of Mandalay's family,

495
00:23:51,013 --> 00:23:52,681
he doesn't like heroes.

496
00:23:52,723 --> 00:23:56,185
I wonder what happened in his
past to make him feel that way.

497
00:23:56,226 --> 00:23:57,978
Next time: "Kota."

498
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:00,439
I can't wait to find out what
the Pussycats' test of courage

499
00:24:00,481 --> 00:24:02,232
has in store for us!

500
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:05,444
[IZUKU]
Go beyond! Plus Ultra!

501
00:24:06,305 --> 00:25:06,674
