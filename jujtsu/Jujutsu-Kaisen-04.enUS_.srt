1
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:09,150
Our window verified the 
curse womb three hours ago.

2
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:12,390
Once 90 percent were successfully evacuated,

3
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:15,140
they made the call to seal off the center.

4
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:18,030
Road Closed

5
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:19,890
Citizens within a 500-meter radius 
have been evacuated, as well.

6
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:22,810
Ijichi-san, question.

7
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:24,680
What's a "window" here?

8
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:29,720
A window is a member of 
Jujutsu Tech who can see curses.

9
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:31,740
They aren't sorcerers, though.

10
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:33,620
Oh, okay.

11
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:34,840
Let's continue.

12
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:37,700
Detainee Block 2.

13
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:43,310
At present, five detainees 
remain there with the curse womb.

14
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:46,300
If this curse womb is the 
type that metamorphoses,

15
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:50,480
we predict it will become 
a special-grade cursed spirit.

16
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:51,990
Special-grade...

17
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:56,900
Hey, so... I still don't really understand 
what "special-grade" means.

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,420
Then allow me to explain it so 
even idiots can understand.

19
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:08,460
*If Conventional Weapons Were Effective Against Cursed Spirits

20
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:08,460
Grade 4

21
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:08,460
A wooden bat is enough

22
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:08,460
Grade 3

23
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:08,460
If you have a handgun, you can rest easy

24
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,490
First, there's grade 4.

25
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:05,390
A wooden bat is enough for them.

26
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:06,290
Grade 3.

27
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:08,180
If you have a handgun, you can rest easy.

28
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:13,960
Grade 3

29
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:13,960
If you have a handgun, you can rest easy

30
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:13,960
Grade 2

31
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:13,960
Close call with a shotgun

32
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:13,960
Grade 1\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h

33
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:13,960
Even a tank may be insufficient

34
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:09,510
Grade 2.

35
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:11,040
It'll be a close call with a shotgun.

36
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:11,840
Grade 1.

37
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,730
Even a tank may be insufficient.

38
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:14,980
Then there's special-grade.

39
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:19,100
Close call with a shotgun

40
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:19,100
Grade 1\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h

41
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:19,100
Even a tank may be insufficient

42
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:19,100
Special-Grade

43
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:19,100
Even footing with a carpet bombing of cluster bombs\h\h\h\h\h

44
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:19,100
Let's say you might be on even footing if 
you carpet bomb it with cluster bombs.

45
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:20,630
That's real bad!

46
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:24,880
Normally a jujutsu sorcerer on par with 
the cursed spirit would take on the mission.

47
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:28,020
On a day like today, 
that would be Gojou-sensei.

48
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:29,230
I-I see.

49
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:31,930
So where is Gojou-sensei?

50
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,610
Away on business.

51
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:34,460
Huh?

52
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:38,800
He's not someone who should be loafing 
around at the school in the first place.

53
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:41,030
Don't expect any souvenirs.

54
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,110
Unfortunately, we're constantly 
short-handed in this business.

55
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:48,990
You'll often have to undertake 
missions beyond your power.

56
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,480
The current case, however,
is an abnormal one, and most urgent.

57
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,550
Do not fight under any circumstances.

58
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:59,020
If you encounter a special-grade,

59
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:01,100
your options are to either run or die.

60
00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:06,100
Please just listen to your fears.

61
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:08,640
Do not forget that your mission here

62
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:11,900
is strictly the verification 
and rescue of survivors.

63
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:12,690
Excuse me!

64
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:14,220
Excuse me, where's Tadashi?!

65
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:15,540
Stop! Stay back!

66
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:16,840
Please stay back!

67
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:20,590
Is Tadashi... Is my son Tadashi all right?!

68
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,350
Please calm down!

69
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:22,820
Hey, stop it!

70
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:23,640
Let go of me!

71
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:25,010
Please stay back! It's dangerous!

72
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:24,810
Let me through!

73
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:26,710
She's a guardian who was here for a visit.

74
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:28,860
Please step away.

75
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:32,910
There's a possibility that someone has 
spread poisonous gas throughout the center.

76
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:36,670
We cannot share any more details at this time.

77
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:37,740
No...

78
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:41,400
Why?

79
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:45,050
Why is this happening?!

80
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,270
Fushiguro, Kugisaki.

81
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,120
We're gonna save them!

82
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:52,710
Of course we are.

83
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:11,950
Jujutsu Kaisen

84
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:26,660
Block 2

85
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:32,040
Episode 4: Curse Womb Must Die

86
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:32,040
Episode 4: Curse Womb Must Die

87
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:30,690
Be careful.

88
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:34,360
I'll put up my Veil.

89
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:37,260
Emerge from darkness, blacker than darkness.

90
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:39,470
Purify that which is impure.

91
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,040
It's becoming night!

92
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,120
It's Veil.

93
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,410
There's a residential area nearby,

94
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:54,780
so this barrier conceals us 
from the outside world.

95
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:56,070
That's incredible!

96
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:57,290
Ignorant.

97
00:04:58,450 --> 00:04:59,190
Demon Dogs!

98
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,370
He'll let us know if the curse gets close.

99
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:09,270
Oh, I see!

100
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:12,620
Good boy, good boy! We're counting on you, okay?

101
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,780
Let's go.

102
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:21,470
Wait!

103
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:26,180
What is this?

104
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:29,240
Wh-What's going on in here?

105
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:32,660
This is a two-story dorm, isn't it?

106
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:36,020
C-C-Calm down! It's a maisonette.

107
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:37,280
No, it's not.

108
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,670
It's the deployment of an 
Innate Domain due to cursed energy.

109
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:43,420
It's my first time seeing one this big.

110
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,290
Where's the door?!

111
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:46,200
Huh?

112
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:49,240
Th-The door's gone!

113
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:52,400
How?! We just came in 
through here, didn't we?!

114
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:55,290
What do we do? 
Ah, what do we do about this?

115
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,290
It'll be fine.

116
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:58,500
The dog remembers the scent of the entrance.

117
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,430
Oh, my!

118
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:02,660
Good boy! Have some jerky!

119
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:04,880
Have all the jerky you want!

120
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,340
You are way too calm!

121
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:08,670
You really are dependable, Fushiguro.

122
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:12,520
Thanks to you, we'll be able to 
rescue people and save ourselves, too.

123
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:16,940
Let's keep moving.

124
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:49,690
Atrocious.

125
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,820
That's... three people, right?

126
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:55,640
Okazaki Tadashi

127
00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:01,350
Is Tadashi... Is my son Tadashi all right?!

128
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:04,810
Let's take this body back.

129
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:06,200
Huh?

130
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,880
It's that woman's son.

131
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:08,880
But...

132
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,620
His face isn't too badly mangled.

133
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:15,270
His mother won't accept it if we tell 
her he's dead, but we don't have a body.

134
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:20,480
We have to find and verify two more.

135
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,080
Leave that body behind.

136
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,560
Quit joking around!

137
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,940
We turned around, and the way 
we got in here was gone!

138
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:27,820
We won't be able to come back for it later!

139
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:30,850
I didn't say to come back for it! 
I said to leave it behind!

140
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:34,190
I have no intention of risking my own life

141
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:37,460
to save someone I had no intention 
of saving in the first place!

142
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:41,500
No intention of saving him? 
What do you mean?!

143
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:43,860
This is a juvenile detention center.

144
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:47,600
Jujutsu sorcerers are granted access to 
all information about the scene beforehand.

145
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,610
This Okazaki Tadashi

146
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:54,300
hit a little girl on her way home from 
school while driving without a license.

147
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:55,120
Youth's Name | Date of Birth
Okazaki Tadashi | August 9th, 2001
Highest Education | Sakakidate High School 
Date of Detention | July 20, 2017
Family History | Only has his birth mother, Okazaki Chisaki (42)...
...gone missing, and cannot be contacted...
...living with his mother in an apartment in Eishuu City...

148
00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:57,620
It was his second offense 
of driving without a license.

149
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:04,410
I know you're stuck on saving lots of people 
and guiding them to proper deaths.

150
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:09,820
But what are you going to do when someone 
you saved kills someone else in the future?

151
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,600
Then why did you bother saving me?!

152
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:17,480
Cut it out!

153
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:20,800
Christ, what are you two doing?!

154
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,250
You're both idiots!

155
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:24,950
Think about the time and place if you—

156
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:28,700
Kugisaki?

157
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:31,580
No way! Demon Dogs should 
have sensed the curse!

158
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,370
Itadori!

159
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,460
We're running!

160
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:41,100
We'll search for Kugisaki la—

161
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,900
There's no mistake.

162
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:49,690
It's a special-grade.

163
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:50,810
I can't move.

164
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,390
Move.

165
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,590
Move! Move! Move! Move!

166
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,400
Help others.

167
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,160
Itadori?

168
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:14,200
Huh?

169
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,900
Damn it, where am I?

170
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:23,910
It's so dark, I can't see a thing.

171
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:27,710
The curse's presence!

172
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:31,270
How can there be so many?!

173
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:37,120
Nue!

174
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:50,470
Don't die on me, Itadori and Kugisaki!

175
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:54,960
I can't escape after it's gotten this close!

176
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,600
Hey, Sukuna!

177
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,560
If I die, you die too, right?

178
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:02,000
If you don't want that, then help me out!

179
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,450
Nope!

180
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,960
Even if the parts of me inside you die,

181
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:09,480
there are eighteen other fragments of my soul.

182
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:15,350
Still, irritatingly enough, 
I don't have control of this body.

183
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:17,650
If you want to switch, go ahead and switch.

184
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:19,470
But once you do,

185
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:23,410
I'll kill that brat before the cursed spirit can!

186
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:25,630
Then I'll go for that woman!

187
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:28,800
She's a lively one. I'll have fun with her.

188
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,480
I'm not going to let you do that.

189
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,800
I bet.

190
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:37,610
But if you're too focused on me, 
your friends are gonna die.

191
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,320
It's not jujutsu.

192
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:50,010
He just unleashed pure cursed energy.

193
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:54,620
Fushiguro!

194
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:56,150
Fushiguro!

195
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,130
Fushiguro!

196
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:01,480
Take Kugisaki and get out of here!

197
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:05,060
I'll keep this one busy 
until you two are out.

198
00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:08,320
As soon as you're out, 
give me some kind of signal.

199
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:12,690
Once you do... I'll switch with Sukuna.

200
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:14,550
You know you can't do that!

201
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:16,610
Not with only one arm against a special-grade!

202
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:17,920
Look closer.

203
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:20,290
It's having fun.

204
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:22,950
It's obviously toying with us.

205
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:25,430
I can at least buy us some time.

206
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:26,880
No!

207
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,080
Fushiguro!

208
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:31,010
Please.

209
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:35,180
Demon Dogs!

210
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:40,300
Find Kugisaki!

211
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:46,230
This is my last one.

212
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:51,460
I should've brought a lot more with me.

213
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:03,910
Trying to say it's easier to move 
around in your underwear?

214
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:05,790
What do I do, though?

215
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:08,550
I have no clue how to use cursed energy.

216
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,510
But for now, that's fine.

217
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:11,800
I just have to buy ti—

218
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:21,080
What was that? A cursed energy barrier?

219
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,930
Ow, ow, ow...

220
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:06,420
It hurts, it hurts, it hurts! Why am I...

221
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:10,830
If only I hadn't picked up 
that finger back then...

222
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:13,200
If I hadn't eaten it...

223
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:14,800
If only...

224
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:16,360
If only...

225
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:18,130
Stop!

226
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:19,380
Don't think!

227
00:13:20,890 --> 00:13:22,220
No! No!

228
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:24,470
I want to run! I want to run! I want to run!

229
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,740
I don't want to die!

230
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,870
If I died here...

231
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:31,370
If I actually died...

232
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,440
Would that be a proper death?!

233
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:41,790
Don't think!

234
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:45,280
Help others.

235
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:48,210
Have I...

236
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:50,790
gotten so weak?

237
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:56,960
I know your face now.

238
00:13:57,210 --> 00:13:59,150
I swear I'll curse you!

239
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:15,180
We're escaping, Kugisaki!

240
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:17,880
I hate frogs, you know.

241
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,170
Yeah, well, sorry!

242
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:28,220
I was so full of myself.

243
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:31,440
I thought I was strong.

244
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:36,180
I thought I was at least strong 
enough to choose when I died.

245
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,330
But I was wrong.

246
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:42,480
I'm weak!

247
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:46,490
I'm far too weak!

248
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:50,500
Augh, I don't want to die!

249
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:53,280
No! No way!

250
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:57,220
But... I am going to die!

251
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,620
A proper death?

252
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:02,830
Yeah, right! Don't be naïve!

253
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:06,630
Jujutsu sorcerers never die without regret.

254
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:12,860
Still, I want to be able to say 
my death was a proper one.

255
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:17,770
The negative emotions of mankind 
become the source of curses.

256
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:25,030
So all the hate, fear, regret...

257
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,320
Let it all out...

258
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,040
And put it in your fist!

259
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:46,110
Damn it!

260
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:51,380
That howl...

261
00:15:56,570 --> 00:15:58,580
It's Fushiguro's signal.

262
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:09,690
What a thoroughly annoying brat.

263
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:15,950
Jujutsu Kaisen

264
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:21,000
Jujutsu Kaisen

265
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,260
What a thoroughly annoying brat.

266
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,570
He's obviously screwing with me.

267
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:34,950
Hold on a moment. I'm thinking right now.

268
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:38,850
What can I do to make that brat regret this?

269
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:45,660
If I went after him, the brat would 
just switch back right beforehand.

270
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:49,250
So the thing that would cause 
him the most trouble...

271
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,670
is probably this.

272
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:53,650
I'll put things back the way they were.

273
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,770
Hey, let's go kill some kids.

274
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:58,870
Follow me.

275
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:07,580
Idiot.

276
00:17:14,690 --> 00:17:18,110
Ah, shit. I healed this one, too.

277
00:17:20,110 --> 00:17:21,710
You don't like walks?

278
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:26,510
Well, cursed spirits are usually 
supposed to stay where they're born.

279
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:28,830
Fine, fine. In that case...

280
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,270
you die here!

281
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:36,700
Hey, what's the matter?

282
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,360
You're not finished already, are you?

283
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,860
That's it. Come on, try harder.

284
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:55,930
Even a cursed spirit

285
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:58,920
would miss their arm, right?

286
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:18,820
Please expand the evacuation 
area to ten kilometers.

287
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:20,080
What about you?

288
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,490
I'm waiting here for Itadori to return.

289
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:24,590
I see.

290
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:29,950
After I take Kugisaki-san to the hospital, 
I'll return as quickly as possible.

291
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:33,840
No, there wouldn't be much 
point in you staying here.

292
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:35,980
If you want to do something,

293
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:39,460
please ask them to send over 
a sorcerer grade 1 or higher.

294
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:41,800
Not that I imagine any are around.

295
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:44,820
I'll do what I can. Later.

296
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:56,030
If the worst case happens...

297
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,800
I don't want to let him die.

298
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,130
They are.

299
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:01,530
Please do something about this.

300
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:06,090
...then it's my responsibility to end him.

301
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:11,210
Hey, did you know?

302
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:16,210
We're both classified as 
special-grade, apparently.

303
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:19,220
Both you and me, man.

304
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,920
Good job, special-grade.

305
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,410
Keep trying.

306
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:41,880
You look happy.

307
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,390
Want me to praise you?

308
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:50,790
But healing with cursed energy isn't that hard 
for cursed spirits, unlike for humans.

309
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:55,390
Neither you nor this brat

310
00:19:56,370 --> 00:19:58,720
really understand

311
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:01,510
what curses truly are.

312
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:04,720
This is a good opportunity, 
so I'll show you...

313
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:07,980
what real jujutsu is.

314
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:11,910
Domain Expansion.

315
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,300
Malevolent Shrine!

316
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:31,940
I was planning to cut you in three slices,

317
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:34,000
but you're really weak.

318
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:37,960
Oh, yeah, and then there's this.

319
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:40,440
I'll be taking this.

320
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:52,000
It's over.

321
00:20:55,810 --> 00:20:57,150
This sucks!

322
00:20:57,150 --> 00:20:59,210
If you're gonna switch, just do it already!

323
00:21:03,290 --> 00:21:05,100
What's the matter, brat?

324
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,510
Juju Stroll

325
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:49,840
Yes, yes, understood.

326
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,740
Thank you very much.

327
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:52,520
Yes.

328
00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:54,720
Stare...

329
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:56,470
What's the matter?

330
00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:59,030
You bow while on the phone.

331
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:07,030
I just get so wrapped up in creating the feeling 
of "I'm on the phone!" while on a call...

332
00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:08,240
I know what you mean.

333
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:13,230
I've hurt my neck several times dealing 
with ingrown hairs while depilating.

334
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:15,290
Of course, I've hurt my pores, too.

335
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:17,040
Is that really the same?

336
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:20,570
You're often irritated when 
you're on the phone, Fushiguro.

337
00:23:20,570 --> 00:23:23,700
That's because of Gojou-sensei, 
not the phone.

338
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:27,320
You often wander around when 
you're on the phone, Itadori.

339
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:28,690
Speaking of phones,

340
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:32,800
can you all stay on a call while holding 
the phone against your shoulder?

341
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:54,990
