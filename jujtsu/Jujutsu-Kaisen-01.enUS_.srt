1
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:03,540
Morning.

2
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:24,120
So which one are you right now?

3
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:28,090
Aren't you...

4
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:29,600
Gojou Satoru.

5
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:32,090
I'm in charge of the 
first-years at Jujutsu Tech.

6
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:34,450
Jujutsu...

7
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:37,320
Fushiguro... Senpai!

8
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,020
What is this?

9
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,740
I'm not sure you should 
be worrying about others,

10
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:49,520
Itadori Yuuji.

11
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:54,110
It's been decided that you'll 
be secretly executed.

12
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:11,960
Jujutsu Kaisen

13
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:31,700
Episode 1: Ryoumen Sukuna

14
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:31,700
Itadori

15
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:30,660
Hello, Sugisawa Hospital.

16
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,710
Oh, this is Itadori.

17
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:33,110
I just called earlier.

18
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:34,430
Yes.

19
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:35,460
Yes.

20
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:37,460
I'm sorry to keep calling,

21
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:39,220
but how is my grandpa doing?

22
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:42,250
Huh? I thought they already told you.

23
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:44,540
Oh, please hold on.

24
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:46,490
I'll go ask myself.

25
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:52,040
Itadori-san never uses his call button.

26
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,980
It's actually scary that he doesn't.

27
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:56,980
Itadori-san, you have a phone call.

28
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:58,950
Yuuji-kun's asking if you 
want him to bring anyâ€”

29
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:00,200
Leave me alone!

30
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,700
Tell him not to come!

31
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:03,950
He should go to his club! His club!

32
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,550
What? What's going on?

33
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:09,980
You heard him.

34
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:11,420
What club are you in, Yuuji-kun?

35
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:13,890
I heard.

36
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:16,210
I'll come by tomorrow evening.

37
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,540
Miyashiro Prefectural Sugisawa Third High School

38
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:33,580
They're keeping a cursed 
object in a place like this?

39
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:35,020
Could they be any dumber?

40
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:49,120
There's nothing here.

41
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,030
Huh?

42
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:52,100
The Stevenson screen's empty.

43
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:54,270
For real? That's hilarious!

44
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:55,770
Maybe it took a nighttime stroll.

45
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:57,040
I'll punch you.

46
00:03:57,330 --> 00:04:00,370
Well, no going home 
until it's recovered, okay?

47
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:05,010
I'm seriously going to punch him next time.

48
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:11,810
Ready to go?

49
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:13,770
Are you really sure,

50
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:13,760
Occult Phenomenon
Research Club

51
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:15,900
Sasaki-senpai?

52
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,020
Iguchi-senpai?

53
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,280
Okay, here we go!

54
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:22,430
Spirits, spirits, please tell us...

55
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:24,980
Which creature is the council 
president just barely weaker than?!

56
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:27,900
Ku

57
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:30,120
Ku-ri-o-ne (sea angel)?

58
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:28,730
ri

59
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:29,320
o

60
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:30,110
ne

61
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:32,940
Sea Angel

62
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:32,940
A type of plankton
living in cold oceans!

63
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:32,940
A transparent
body!

64
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:32,940
It's actually
related
to mollusks!

65
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:32,940
It moves its legs,
which look
like wings,
to float around.

66
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:32,940
When capturing prey,
its mouth pops open
and shoots out tentacles!

67
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:32,940
Eek!

68
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:31,860
A sea angel can beat him?!

69
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:33,410
What a small fry!

70
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:34,720
Occult club!

71
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,330
Hey, Plankton President! What's up?

72
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,280
Notice

73
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:40,580
As you were previously informed,

74
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:43,540
a research club with no real activities 
must forfeit its club room.

75
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:45,070
So vacate this room at once!

76
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:49,350
You shouldn't underestimate 
our members, President.

77
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:50,140
Mysterious Events
File 9

78
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:53,150
What is that?

79
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:57,440
You know about our rugby field 
being closed off, right?

80
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:58,720
Yes.

81
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,570
Some of the students who fell 
ill were actually hospitalized.

82
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:03,490
Don't you think that's strange?

83
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:05,700
We're talking about tough rugby players here.

84
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:09,290
Truth is, the players said 
they started hearing

85
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:10,280
B
i
n
g

86
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:13,790
O
o
o
o
o

87
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,790
mysterious sounds and voices 
right before they fell ill.

88
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:17,250
That's when we found this newspaper 
article from thirty years ago.

89
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:20,540
Belongings Found
on Roadside, 
Possible Crime

90
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:20,790
It talks about the disappearance of Yoshida-san, 
who worked with the construction company,

91
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:19,380
Former Employee, Age 35, Goes Missing at Sugisawa

92
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:20,540
Former Employee of a
Major Construction Company
Never Made a Comeback
and Went Into Debt

93
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:23,120
Last
Sighted
at
Sugisawa
Third

94
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:23,120
Laid Off from Work
Failed to Start New Enterprise
Possible Suicide

95
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:25,800
and it mentions he was last sighted here at 
Sugisawa Third High School during construction.

96
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:29,010
Laid Off from Work
Failed to Start New Enterprise

97
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:29,320
Yoshida-san was struggling to make ends meet,

98
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:31,010
Continuous Collection Calls
Threatening Calls and Faxes

99
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,760
so he turned to loan sharks

100
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,810
and those organizations were after him.

101
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:32,800
Suspicious Men at His Home
Possible Kidnapping

102
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:34,320
Which means!

103
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,480
The whole disaster at the 
rugby field was caused by

104
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:40,810
the vengeful spirit of Yoshida-san, 
who's buried there!

105
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:41,110
Vengeful Spirit

106
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:43,320
No, it was caused by ticks.

107
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:43,320
Vengeful Spirit

108
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:52,190
Hard Ticks

109
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:52,190
A large,
parasitic tick
that sucks the blood
of animals and humans!

110
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:52,190
Be careful, because they can be carriers of
infectious diseases that lead to death if they bite humans!

111
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:52,190
Diseases such as Severe Fever with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome (SFTS)

112
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:52,190
Hmm?

113
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:52,190
They leap onto targets
from grass and bushes.

114
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:52,190
Burp

115
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:52,190
Leap

116
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:52,190
Size

117
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:52,190
Before Blood

118
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:52,190
After Blood

119
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:52,190
After sucking blood, their size
can increase up to 100x!

120
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:46,330
Hard ticks.

121
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:48,200
A large, blood-sucking bug.

122
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:51,140
If one bites you and infects you with SFTS,

123
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:52,570
it can be fatal, so be very careful.

124
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:53,920
So what?!

125
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,330
The occult club is trying 
to uncover occult activity,

126
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:58,080
so it's still a proper club activity report!

127
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,230
This isn't some kid's game!

128
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:01,760
Besides, the biggest problem is you,

129
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,180
Itadori Yuuji!

130
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:05,380
You're registered with track 
and field, not the occult club,

131
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:10,050
so this club doesn't even have the 
three members required for any club!

132
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:10,040
Not Enough Members

133
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:10,970
Huh?

134
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:12,430
Itadori...

135
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:14,560
No, I know I wrote down the occult club.

136
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,560
I rewrote it!

137
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,990
The track and field coach, Takagi!

138
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:21,940
Itadori, we need you so we 
can conquer the nationals!

139
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:25,610
A teacher more problematic than 
the students just showed up...

140
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:29,170
Give it a rest! How many times 
do I have to tell you I refuse?

141
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:29,770
You can't!

142
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:30,570
Why can't I?!

143
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:32,620
However, I'm not some demon!

144
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:34,990
If you can beat me, then I'll give up on you.

145
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:38,500
Let's settle it fair and square on the track!

146
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,900
Now it's interesting!

147
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,650
You're on!

148
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:47,840
Track and Field Coach

149
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:47,840
Takagi

150
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:47,840
Itadori

151
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:47,470
Is it "fair and square" to rewrite 
a student's club application?

152
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:54,910
What's with this rugby field?

153
00:06:57,470 --> 00:07:00,060
Is there a dead body 
buried here or something?

154
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:01,980
Even if there is,

155
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,620
I'm surprised to see one this high-leveled.

156
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,060
That's probably a grade 2 curse.

157
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,530
Must be that cursed object's influence.

158
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:19,030
No Unauthorized Entry

159
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:12,870
Damn it.

160
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:15,160
Its presence is too strong to pin down.

161
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:18,490
It feels like it's close by, 
but it could still be far away, too.

162
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:22,290
This special-grade cursed 
object is a serious pain.

163
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:25,090
Who could have moved it?

164
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:26,610
Where is it now?

165
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:28,870
Over here!

166
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:32,250
Coach Takagi is taking on 
Itadori from West Middle!

167
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:34,270
Wow, what are they competing in?

168
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:37,750
Yeah!

169
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,270
Fourteen meters!

170
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:41,840
*Japan's National Record

171
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:44,620
Wow, Takagi's still got it!

172
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:54,320
Itadori! Itadori!

173
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:46,080
What're you gonna do, Itadori?!

174
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,130
Hey, is Itadori famous or something?

175
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:51,590
They're probably tall tales, but I heard 
he beat all stages of Ninja Warrior,

176
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:53,890
and that he's the reincarnation 
of Mirko Cro Cop.

177
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:56,830
But Mirko's not even dead yet.

178
00:07:57,330 --> 00:07:59,890
Still, he earned the nickname 
"Tiger of West Middle."

179
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:01,080
Lame.

180
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,340
Hey, can I just throw this however I want?

181
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:06,520
Yep. I won't call any fouls, 
so throw however you please.

182
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,590
Sorry.

183
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:09,950
I wanted to demonstrate how 
serious I am by intentionally

184
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:12,050
choosing something that isn't your forteâ€”

185
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:19,060
Uh, roughly thirty meters.

186
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:19,050
*World Record

187
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:21,520
Yeah, I win!

188
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,830
He's more gorilla than tiger, isn't he?

189
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:25,520
That was a pitcher's throw.

190
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,020
Itadori, you'd do well on a sports team.

191
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:32,110
You don't have to force yourself to 
stay in our occult club, y'know.

192
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:33,060
Huh?

193
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:35,960
But as much as you two love scary things,

194
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,990
you couldn't go to haunted 
places without me, could you?

195
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:39,010
Shiver

196
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:39,010
Tremble

197
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:39,010
3 Days Ago

198
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:40,620
We're scared because we like it.

199
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,040
Yay!

200
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:43,800
Besides, this school requires 
everyone to be in a club, right?

201
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,250
I couldn't keep up with this.

202
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:48,070
You don't have to do anything!
You can be a ghost member!

203

Occult Phenomenon
Research Club

204
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:49,540
We're the occult club, after all!

205
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:51,760
I did say that.

206
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,850
I want to be able to go home 
by 5 PM for my own reasons.

207
00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:56,760
So if it's okay with you, I'd like to stay.

208
00:08:57,250 --> 00:09:00,010
I like the atmosphere of 
the occult club a lot.

209
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:02,520
Well, if that's how it is, we don't mind.

210
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:03,740
Yeah.

211
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,550
That guy's incredible.

212
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:09,320
He pulled that off without any cursed energy.

213
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,860
I wonder if he's like Zenin-senpai...

214
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,790
Oh, it's already half past four!

215
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:17,280
Well, Coach, I've got stuff to do! Later!

216
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,440
The presence of a cursed object!

217
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,210
Hey, you!

218
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:31,400
He's way too fast!

219
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:34,290
I heard he can run fifty 
meters in three seconds.

220
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:35,720
Is he a car?

221
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,710

Saitou

225
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,270
I told you not to come.

226
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:53,760
Stop buying flowers to bring 
with you all the time.

227
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,200
You always give me that.

228
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,240
Besides, these aren't for you. 
They're for the nurses.

229
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,680
All the more reason not to, you fool!

230
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,490
And what about your club?

231
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:02,970
Go to your club! Your club!

232
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:04,870
Oh, chill out.

233
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:06,800
It ends before 5 PM.

234
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,930
I wouldn't be visiting you 
if I didn't have the free time.

235
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:11,130
Good.

236
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:14,130
Then listen to me, since I've got free time, too.

237
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:15,680
Not interested.

238
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,180
Just listen well.

239
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:19,930
There's something I want 
to tell you before the end.

240
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:22,470
It's about your parents.

241
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:24,140
I said I'm not interested.

242
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:28,100
Grandpa, could stop trying to 
act all cool before you die?

243
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:31,600
Every man wants to go out in style, you know!

244
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,790
Get a clue, you useless grandson!

245
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:36,070
Quit snapping over everything.

246
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:38,640
You can just be yourself.

247
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:42,850
Tsk. Lax upbringing.

248
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,540
Yuuji.

249
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:51,540
Hmm?

250
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:54,790
You're a strong kid, so help others.

251
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:58,900
Even if it's only those closest to you, 
just save the people you can.

252
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:00,380
It's okay if you lose your way,

253
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:03,140
and don't worry about whether 
they'll thank you or not.

254
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:06,520
Just save as many people as you can, 
even if it's only one.

255
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,530
When you die, you should 
be surrounded by people.

256
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:13,570
Don't end up like me.

257
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:25,520

Yes, what's the matter?

266
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,990
Hello?

267
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:35,170
Itadori-san?!

268
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,660
Hello?

269
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:45,140
My grandpa... is dead.

270
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,570
Notification of Death

271
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:12,080
Okay.

272
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:14,270
That's all of the necessary paperwork.

273
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:16,620
Okay. Thank you for everything.

274
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:18,340
Are you sure you're okay?

275
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:22,330
Well, this is my first time dealing 
with something like this,

276
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:24,800
so it doesn't feel real yet.

277
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:29,510
Grandpa would snap if I kept 
moping around forever, though,

278
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:31,890
so I'll just have to laugh as I roast him up.

279
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:33,250
Phrasing!

280
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:36,860
Itadori Yuuji, right?

281
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,930
I'm Fushiguro from Jujutsu Tech.

282
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:42,670
I'd like to have a word with you.

283
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:43,360
Now.

284
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:45,990
Um, I'm in mourning right now.

285
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:47,620
Sorry, but there isn't time.

286
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:50,310
The cursed object you 
possess is very dangerous.

287
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:51,980
Hand it over to me right now.

288
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,370
Cursed object?

289
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:54,770
This.

290
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,590
Oh, yeah, yeah. I found that.

291
00:12:58,590 --> 00:13:02,510
I don't mind either way, 
but my senpai took a liking to it.

292
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:04,250
What do you mean, "dangerous"?

293
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:07,800
The number of unexplained 
deaths and missing persons

294
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:11,010
within Japan exceeds 
10,000 a year on average.

295

4th-grade Girl Commits Suicide. Bullying Suspected.

296
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,010
Head of Nursing Home in Mifune Ward Stabbed to Death.
Former Patient Unindicted Once Again

297
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:14,540
Most of those are the result of curses.

298
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:16,530
Curses?

299
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:18,710
I don't care if you believe in them or not.

300
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:20,020
They're real.

301
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:21,530
I'll go on.

302
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:26,030
Large pools of negative energy form especially 
easily in schools, hospitals, and so on.

303
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:29,070
Hardship, regret, shame...

304
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:32,060
The negative emotions of mankind 
become the source of curses.

305
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:37,000
That's why most schools secretly keep a 
cursed object such as a protective talisman.

306
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:39,500
The object you found is one of them.

307
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:42,260
If it's protecting us, shouldn't 
we be grateful for it?

308
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:43,630
Let me finish.

309
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,820
Placing a cursed object of greater evil

310
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:49,140
is a deadly poison that 
keeps other curses away.

311
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:51,950
It's a bad practice that 
only claims to protect.

312
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:55,570
Over the years, its seal weakens,

313
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:59,520
and then it becomes bait to lure 
in and fatten up other curses.

314
00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:02,440
The object you found

315
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:05,540
is a dangerous one, 
classified as special-grade.

316
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:07,450
Hand it over before people start dying.

317
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:10,510
Hey, I already said I don't mind that.

318
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:12,000
So go tell it to my senpai.

319
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,260
It's empty?

320
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:17,050
I was just following the 
taint clinging to the box?!

321
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:20,420
Where are the contents?!

322
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:23,390
I already told you, my senpai... have it...

323
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:24,970
What?

324
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:29,050
Actually, they were talking about removing 
the talisman from it tonight at the school.

325
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:33,750
What? Is that bad?

326
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:37,390
It's worse than bad.

327
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:40,530
They're going to die.

328
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:46,910
I can't get it off.

329
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:49,730
Did we really need to sneak in to do this?

330
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:51,030
I'm turning on the lights.

331
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:53,360
No! The atmosphere's important!

332
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,280
Enjoying the thrill is in the 
spirit of the occult club, isn't it?

333
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,650
It's not like anything's 
going to happen, anyway.

334
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:01,550
Oh, it came off!

335
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:17,350
A human finger?

336
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:19,350
Is it real?

337
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:24,540
Is this...

338
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,520
What is this?

339
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:35,450
Do talismans come off that easily?

340
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:38,540
No, it's impossible for people 
who lack cursed energy.

341
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:40,440
Normally.

342
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,900
Go right! It's a shortcut!

343
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:45,170
This time the object itself is too strong.

344
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:48,230
The seal is ancient. 
It might as well be plain paper.

345
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:52,300
I still don't get all this stuff about curses.

346
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:53,530
Where are they?

347
00:15:53,530 --> 00:15:54,760
Fourth floor!

348
00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:00,800
What is this pressure?

349
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,440
You stay here.

350
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:05,150
I'm coming, too!

351
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:06,440
It's dangerous, right?

352
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,450
I've only known them a few months,

353
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:10,440
but they're my friends. I can't just stand by!

354
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,700
Stay here.

355
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:17,070
Occult Phenomenon
Research Club

356
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:24,000
What time is it?

357
00:16:25,130 --> 00:16:32,050
The hour hand is at eleven.

358
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:34,080
What is that monster?

359
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,810
S-Sasaki...

360
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:38,770
Iguchi? Thank goodness! Where have youâ€”

361
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:41,920
Help me...

362
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:48,070
What time is it?

363
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:50,030
The curse has been unleashed!

364
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:52,610
Its presence is still all over the place!

365
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:55,410
Slurp, slurp.

366
00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:56,780
Out of the way!

367
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:58,200
Demon Dogs!

368
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:05,620
Slurp.

369
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:07,300
You can eat it.

370
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:12,320
Am I just going to wait 
here like he told me to?

371
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:15,630
What am I so afraid of?

372
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:18,220
They're going to die.

373
00:17:18,610 --> 00:17:19,890
That's right.

374
00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:21,980
I can sense death all the way out here.

375
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:24,010
I'm afraid of dying.

376
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:25,660
Was I afraid of it then?

377
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:28,230
It didn't feel like I was, though.

378
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:31,510
I didn't cry because I was scared.

379
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:33,480
I was just a little sad.

380
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:37,990
But my grandpa's death 
and the death I'm facing now...

381
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:40,490
How are they any different?

382
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:44,370
You're a strong kid, so help others.

383
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:52,310
The curses are growing in number.

384
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:53,390
They're close.

385
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,470
Found them.

386
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,140
He was short-tempered and stubborn.

387
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:09,150
No one but me ever paid him a visit.

388
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,020
"Don't end up like me," huh?

389
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:14,650
That's true.

390
00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:17,860
Damn it! Is it trying to swallow her 
along with the cursed object?!

391
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:20,820
I'm not gonna make it!

392
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:31,540
Itadori!

393
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:35,170
I think you had a proper death, Grandpa.

394
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,510
But...

395
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:41,080
This death...

396
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:44,970
is wrong!

397
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:51,370
So this is a curse?

398
00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:53,070
Not what I was expecting.

399
00:18:57,790 --> 00:19:00,320
I want to ask you what you're doing here,

400
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,670
but good job.

401
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:03,250
Why so haughty?

402
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:07,450
By the way, what's that 
munching on the curse?

403
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:08,990
My shikigami.

404
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:10,790
You can see them, then?

405
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:13,100
Normally a curse can't be seen.

406
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:16,190
Not unless you're on the verge of 
death or in special places like this.

407
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:18,070
Yeah, that makes sense.

408
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:20,720
I've never seen a ghost or 
anything before tonight.

409
00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:23,720
You're not scared, are you?

410
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:26,710
Well, I was scared for a bit.

411
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:27,860
But did you know?

412
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:29,690
People really can die.

413
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:30,690
Huh?

414
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:36,040
So I at least want the people 
I know to have proper deaths.

415
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,540
Not that I really get it myself.

416
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:39,390
Whoa.

417
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:40,390
This it?

418
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:41,400
Yeah.

419
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:44,330
That's the special-grade cursed 
object, Ryoumen Sukuna's finger.

420
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:46,630
It's a miracle it didn't get swallowed.

421
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:48,050
Why would anything eat it?

422
00:19:48,050 --> 00:19:49,120
Does it taste good?

423
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:49,960
Don't be stupid.

424
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,440
You'd do it to gain stronger cursed energy.

425
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,460
It's dangerous, so hand it over already.

426
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:56,110
Sure, sure.

427
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:01,800
Run!

428
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,310
Fushiguro!

429
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:14,770
Nue!

430
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:39,440
Damn it, I can't think straight.

431
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:41,750
Itadori!

432
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:44,890
Why can't you understand 
to take those two and run?!

433
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:47,980
You're in big trouble yourself!

434
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:54,420
Only curses can exorcise other curses!

435
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:55,690
You can't beat it!

436
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:57,820
Is this the time to be saying that?!

437
00:20:57,820 --> 00:21:00,320
You're going to die at this rate!

438
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:04,990
If I went home now, I'd be having nightmares!

439
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:06,240
Besides,

440
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:11,000
I have my own...

441
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Help others.

442
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,780
...troublesome curse already!

443
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:26,790
You idiot!

444
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:29,350
Hand it over to me or you'll be eaten, too!

445
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,990
Why would anything eat it?

446
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:36,030
Does it taste good?

447
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:37,310
Don't be stupid.

448
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:39,400
You'd do it to gain stronger cursed energy.

449
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:45,510
There is a way to save everyone!

450
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:47,950
I just need some cursed energy, 
right, Fushiguro?!

451
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:49,950
Don't!

452
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:51,380
Don't do it!

453
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:54,730
Ryoumen Sukuna's finger!

454
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:56,380
That's a special-grade cursed object!

455
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:58,790
It's a deadly poison! He'll die for sure!

456
00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:01,370
But there's a one in a million...

457
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:03,300
a one in a million chance...

458
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:45,550
Ah, I knew it!

459
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:48,630
The light feels best in the flesh!

460
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,680
This is the worst!

461
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,600
A one-in-a-million-chance,
worst-case outcome!

462
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:55,570
The special-grade cursed 
object has incarnated!

463
00:22:55,570 --> 00:22:57,990
A cursed spirit's flesh is so boring.

464
00:22:57,990 --> 00:23:00,980
Where are the people? The women?!

465
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:04,580
What a wonderful era to be in.

466
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:08,550
Women and children are crawling 
everywhere like maggots.

467
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:10,800
Marvelous!

468
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,560
It'll be a massacre!

469
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:20,390
What do you think you're doing with my body?

470
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:21,380
Give it back.

471
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:23,880
How are you able to move?

472
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:26,420
I mean, it's my body.

473
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,510
He's suppressing me?

474
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:30,880
Don't move.

475
00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:33,600
You're no longer human.

476
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:39,180
Under Jujutsu regulations, Itadori Yuuji,

477
00:23:40,050 --> 00:23:43,540
I will exorcise you as a curse!

478
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:55,650
Episode 2:

For Myself
