1
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:04,940
Under Jujutsu regulations, Itadori Yuuji,

2
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:07,870
I will exorcise you as a curse!

3
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:11,600
Wait, really, I'm just fine!

4
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:14,320
More importantly, you and I 
are both pretty beat up.

5
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:15,910
Let's get to a hospital.

6
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:20,950
I can't tell if the one speaking right now 
is Itadori or the cursed object...

7
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:23,270
Damn it! What should I do?!

8
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,460
What's the situation?

9
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:28,890
Gojou-sensei?! Why are you here?

10
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:29,550
Hey.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,890
I wasn't planning on coming,

12
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:34,300
but man, you're roughed up.

13
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:37,080
I should show the second-years.

14
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:38,470
Face this way.

15
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:43,400
The higher-ups wouldn't shut up with a 
special-grade cursed object gone missing.

16
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,840
So I stopped by while 
doing some sightseeing.

17
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,860
So, did you find it?

18
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,290
Um...

19
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:53,990
Sorry, but I ate it.

20
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:56,990
For real?

21
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:57,830
For real.

22
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,100
Damn, it really did combine with you.

23
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:10,960
That's hilarious.

24
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:13,300
Anything off with your body?

25
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,950
Not particularly.

26
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:16,510
Can you swap out with Sukuna?

27
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:17,680
Sukuna?

28
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:19,480
The curse you ate.

29
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:22,470
Oh... Yeah, I think I can do that.

30
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:24,940
Then give us ten seconds.

31
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:27,180
Once ten seconds are up, come back to us.

32
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:28,420
But...

33
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:32,140
Don't worry, I'm the strongest.

34
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,530
Megumi, hold on to this.

35
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:36,340
What is it?

36
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:38,160
Kikufuku from Kikusuian.

37
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:42,910
Kikufuku

38
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:40,370
It's Sendai's specialty, and it's super good.

39
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:42,870
I recommend the zunda and cream flavor.

40
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:45,280
This guy actually went and bought souvenirs!

41
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,030
When people were out here dying!

42
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:48,130
It's not a souvenir.

43
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:51,180
I'm going to eat it on the bullet train home.

44
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:52,980
Behind you!

45
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:55,340
Kikufuku's not like other souvenirs...

46
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:07,400
And the whipped cream 
inside is simply exquisite...

47
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:16,320
My student's watching,

48
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,940
so I'm going to show off a little.

49
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,560
He's unbelievably fast?

50
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,750
No, that's not it...

51
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:33,220
For crying out loud...

52
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:36,160
You jujutsu sorcerers are always trouble,

53
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,720
no matter what the era!

54
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:49,500
Though that doesn't mean much to me.

55
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,070
Seven...

56
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:53,320
Eight...

57
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:54,570
Nine...

58
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,120
Should be time.

59
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:00,290
Damn it... Again?

60
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:01,720
I can't take over.

61
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:08,780
Who the hell is this... Itadori... brat?

62
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:11,460
Oh, was everything okay?

63
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:13,370
I'm shocked.

64
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:15,360
You really can control it.

65
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,680
He's kind of annoying, though.

66
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,260
I can hear his voice.

67
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,090
It's a miracle that's all he's doing.

68
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:31,690
What did you do?

69
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:33,520
Knocked him out.

70
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:38,800
If he isn't possessed by 
Sukuna when he wakes up,

71
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,840
he might have potential as a vessel.

72
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,620
Now, I have a question for you.

73
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:45,420
What should we do with him?

74
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:50,300
Even if he is a vessel,

75
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:53,480
jujutsu regulations demand 
Itadori be executed.

76
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:54,810
However...

77
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:57,750
I don't want to let him die.

78
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:00,070
Your personal feelings?

79
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:02,790
Yes. Please do something about this.

80
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:06,720
Now it's a request from a precious student.

81
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:08,540
Leave it to me!

82
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:11,180
With that, allow me to say it once more.

83
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:13,400
You're being executed.

84
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:17,490
The recap and current 
events don't line up, though.

85
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:19,610
Hey, I did my best.

86
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:23,090
The execution's still on, 
but I got your sentence suspended.

87
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:24,790
Suspended?

88
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,000
So you're not killing me right away?

89
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,380
Yup.

90
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:29,890
I'll explain from the top.

91
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:33,660
This is the same as the cursed object you ate.

92
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:35,340
There are twenty in total.

93
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:38,010
We possess six of them.

94
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:39,130
Twenty?

95
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,720
Oh, each finger and toe?

96
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,970
No, Sukuna has four arms.

97
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,400
As you can see, we can't destroy them.

98
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,450
The curse is just that powerful.

99
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:58,180
The curse grows stronger by the day,

100
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:01,440
and the seals of modern-day 
jujutsu sorcerers can't keep up.

101
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,910
That's where you come in.

102
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,950
When you die, the curse 
inside you will die, as well.

103
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:10,750
Our elders are cowards, you know.

104
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:13,200
They're demanding we kill you right away.

105
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,660
But that would be a waste, wouldn't it?

106
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:18,030
A waste?

107
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:22,550
There's no guarantee another vessel capable 
of handling Sukuna will ever be born again.

108
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:24,930
So this is what I proposed:

109
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:27,860
If we're going to kill you anyway,

110
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:30,880
why not kill you after you've 
absorbed all of Sukuna?

111
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:33,760
The higher-ups agreed.

112
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:36,870
So now you have two options before you.

113
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:38,970
You can die right now,

114
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,840
or you can find all the parts of Sukuna

115
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,070
and die after you've absorbed them.

116
00:05:55,040 --> 00:06:02,000
Jujutsu Kaisen

117
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:17,450
Sugisawa Hospital

118
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:17,450
Sugisawa Hospital

119
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:23,960
Episode 2:         For Myself

120
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,000
Itadori.

121
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:31,090
How's Iguchi-senpai doing?

122
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:36,910
The doctors say he's fine,

123
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:39,350
but he hasn't regained consciousness.

124
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:42,000
It's all my fault.

125
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:46,210
If I hadn't asked him to come
to the school that night...

126
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:51,320
I know you won't believe this,

127
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:55,660
but this weird monster attacked us,

128
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:57,340
and I was captured, too.

129
00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:59,050
I believe you.

130
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:02,000
Those weren't monsters. They were curses.

131
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:08,310
That finger was a special-grade cursed object.

132
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:11,480
It had the power to draw other 
curses to it and make them stronger.

133
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,470
So it wasn't your fault.

134
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:17,740
It was mine for picking it up.

135
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:21,440
Sorry.

136
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,360
It'll be all right, though.

137
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:26,880
Someone capable of fixing 
Iguchi-senpai will be here tomorrow.

138
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:28,990
Itadori?

139
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:30,910
Sorry, Senpai.

140
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:32,990
There's somewhere I need to go.

141
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:35,940
Bye-bye.

142
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,220
Who passed away?

143
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:50,350
My grandpa. Although he 
was like a father to me.

144
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:54,300
I see. Sorry it happened at a time like that.

145
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:59,090
So have you decided what you want to do?

146
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:04,550
Are casualties like these 
from curses pretty common?

147
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:08,380
This one was a rather exceptional case,

148
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:11,280
but in terms of the damage, 
it happens all the time.

149
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:14,790
It's a good night when someone dies 
a normal death after encountering a curse.

150
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:22,790
Finding a body that's all torn apart 
is on the better end of the outcomes.

151
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:33,160
If you plan to hunt down Sukuna, 
you're going to witness some gruesome scenes,

152
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:37,220
and I can't guarantee you 
won't end up that way yourself.

153
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:40,930
So choose your hell.

154
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:52,580
You're a strong kid, so help others.

155
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:02,000
If all the parts of Sukuna were gone,

156
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:08,210
would there be fewer people 
who get harmed by curses?

157
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,260
Of course.

158
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,420
Do you still have that finger?

159
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:29,680
Looking at it again, it's pretty disgusting.

160
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,750
Well, that's the second one. 
One tenth of the whole.

161
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:42,180
What's going to happen?

162
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,560
Gross!

163
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,140
So gross it's funny.

164
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:08,160
That settles it.

165
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:10,980
It's not just a physical tolerance.

166
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:13,420
He can control himself 
against Sukuna without issue.

167
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,660
We haven't seen someone with 
talent like that in a thousand years.

168
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:18,400
Something wrong?

169
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:20,260
Oh, it's nothing.

170
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:24,320
I take it this means you've 
steeled your resolve?

171
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:27,520
Not at all.

172
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,110
I'm still wondering why 
I have to be executed.

173
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:33,520
But I can't just do nothing about the curse.

174
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:37,610
That last request is gonna be a pain in my ass.

175
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:43,020
I'll eat every part of Sukuna. 
I don't care what happens from there.

176
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:47,190
I've already decided how I'm going to die.

177
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:50,920
Nice! I like people like you.

178
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:53,330
Sounds like a fun hell awaits.

179
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:55,920
Make sure you're packed 
by the end of the day.

180
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:56,880
We going somewhere?

181
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:58,840
Tokyo.

182
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:01,430
Fushiguro! You're looking good!

183
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:03,090
You think so after seeing this?

184
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:07,790
You're going to transfer to the same 
school for jujutsu sorcerers I attend.

185
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:08,580
Huh?

186
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:13,460
Tokyo Metropolitan Jujutsu 
Technical High School.

187
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:17,180
By the way, you're the third first-year.

188
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:18,320
Only three?!

189
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:30,450
Okay, I'm heading out, Grandpa.

190
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:33,060
Itadori Family Grave

191
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,840
This is really deep in the mountains!

192
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,450
Is this actually Tokyo?

193
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:40,720
Even Tokyo's like this on the outskirts.

194
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:42,270
Where's Fushiguro?

195
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,920
He's been treated by a sorcerer, 
and now he's fast asleep.

196
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:50,710
Tokyo Metropolitan Jujutsu 
Technical High School.

197
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:54,710
Tokyo Metropolitan
Jujutsu Technical High School

198
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:54,700
It's one of only two jujutsu 
educational facilities.

199
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:58,190
On the surface, it's known 
as a private religious school.

200
00:12:59,330 --> 00:13:04,220
Many jujutsu sorcerers continue 
to use it as a base after graduation,

201
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:06,160
so it's a pillar of the jujutsu community

202
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,590
not just in education, but for
support and mediation in missions.

203
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,650
Anyway, you're about to have 
an interview with the principal.

204
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:15,710
The principal?

205
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:19,750
Screw it up and he could reject 
your admission, so go all-out.

206
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:20,750
Huh?!

207
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:23,140
And what then? Immediate execution?!

208
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:24,240
What?

209
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:27,000
So you're not the boss?

210
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:31,460
Any hierarchy other 
than strength is worthless.

211
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,370
Sorry, Sensei.

212
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:35,820
He pops out sometimes.

213
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:38,290
What an amusing body you have now.

214
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:40,890
I owe you a favor, you know.

215
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:40,890
Not again!

216
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:45,200
Once I make this brat's body my own, 
you'll be the first one I kill!

217
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:48,510
It's an honor to be targeted by Sukuna.

218
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:51,120
This guy's really that famous?

219
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:56,720
Ryoumen Sukuna is a fierce imaginary 
god with four arms and two faces.

220
00:13:57,390 --> 00:13:59,950
But he's actually a human that really existed,

221
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:02,160
though it was over a thousand years ago.

222
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:05,070
In the golden age of jujutsu,

223
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:08,840
sorcerers gathered up all their might 
to challenge him and failed.

224
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:11,380
Crowned with the title of Sukuna,

225
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:14,440
we couldn't even destroy his grave wax

226
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:17,100
as he traversed the ages 
after death as a cursed object.

227
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:19,880
Without a doubt, he is the king of curses.

228
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:23,030
Who's stronger, you or him?

229
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:25,080
Well...

230
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:27,760
If Sukuna regained all of his power,

231
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,340
it might be a little draining.

232
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:30,710
Would you lose?

233
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:33,190
I'd win.

234
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:43,000
You're late, Satoru.

235
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,360
Eight minutes late.

236
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:48,410
Not enough to chastise you for,

237
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:51,950
but I know I told you to fix 
your habit of being late.

238
00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:55,510
That old dude's making cute things!

239
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:58,700
If it's not enough to chastise me for, 
then don't chastise me.

240
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,050
You're just making dolls, anyway.
What's a measly eight minutes?

241
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,730
That's Principal Yaga Masamichi.

242
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,940
That's the boy?

243
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,590
Itadori Yuuji!

244
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:12,710
I'm into girls like Jennifer Lawrence! 
Pleasure to meet you!

245
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:14,040
What did you come here for?

246
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:16,910
An interview.

247
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:18,740
But why Jujutsu Tech?

248
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,600
To learn jujutsu?

249
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,280
I mean beyond that.

250
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:29,600
What do you hope to find once you've studied 
curses and learned how to exorcise them?

251
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:35,460
Well, I mean... I'm going to 
collect the fingers of Sukuna.

252
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:37,440
It's dangerous to just leave them as is.

253
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,380
Why?

254
00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:44,090
People you'll never know 
die every day due to crimes,

255
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:47,090
accidents, and diseases 
in the natural course of life.

256
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:48,750
Here he goes again.

257
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:53,090
But you're telling me you can't overlook it 
when that death is caused by a curse?

258
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:55,410
It was someone's dying wish.

259
00:15:55,410 --> 00:15:57,330
I don't care about the details.

260
00:15:57,630 --> 00:15:59,560
I just want to save people.

261
00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:01,560
A dying wish?

262
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:06,750
So you're saying you'll fight against curses 
because someone else told you to?

263
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,010
You fail.

264
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:17,430
Those weren't dolls?!

265
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:20,640
Cursed corpses. They're dolls.

266
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:23,390
Dolls infused with my curse.

267
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:29,850
It's heavy!

268
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:35,530
Is that really a doll?!

269
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:40,160
A person's true nature 
reveals itself during a crisis.

270
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:44,330
I'll keep attacking you until 
I get an acceptable answer.

271
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:48,840
Look, man, it wasn't just "someone else."

272
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:52,170
It was a family member's dying wish!

273
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,500
Shit, where is it?!

274
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:09,570
Ow...

275
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:11,510
A family member is still "someone else."

276
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:20,500
Right, it's a doll.

277
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,610
It doesn't get hurt or frightened.

278
00:17:22,610 --> 00:17:25,570
A jujutsu sorcerer is 
constantly facing death.

279
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:27,530
And not just their own death.

280
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:33,030
Sometimes you must ignore those murdered 
by a curse to rend the flesh from it.

281
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,160
It's an unpleasant job.

282
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:39,520
You have to be a little crazy 
and highly motivated to handle it.

283
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:42,340
You'd do that because 
someone else told you to?

284
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:43,840
Don't make me laugh.

285
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:48,080
It'd be more believable if you told me you 
were doing it to postpone your execution.

286
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,340
Screw you! I—

287
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:54,990
Are you going to blame your grandfather 
when you're killed by a curse, too?

288
00:17:57,860 --> 00:18:01,640
You say some pretty damn 
harsh things, old man.

289
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:04,140
Education is making people realize things.

290
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:07,470
I'm not really...

291
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:18,830
It's not easy to imagine how 
you'll feel on the verge of death.

292
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:22,180
However, I can say one thing for certain.

293
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:27,010
At the rate you're going, you could end 
up cursing your beloved grandfather.

294
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:30,250
Jujutsu sorcerers never die without regret.

295
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:32,220
I'll ask you once more.

296
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:36,590
Why have you come here to Jujutsu Tech?

297
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:41,860
I was always better than 
most in sports and in fights.

298
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:47,640
But never once did I think, 
"This is something only I can do."

299
00:18:53,570 --> 00:18:57,200
Consuming Sukuna is something only I can do.

300
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,680
If I managed to escape my death sentence

301
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,600
and ran away from this responsibility,

302
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:06,410
I'd be there eating food, 
taking a bath, or reading manga,

303
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:09,830
and the moment I stopped to think, I'd go,

304
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:16,420
"Oh, I bet someone's dying because of 
Sukuna right now," and become depressed.

305
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:18,220
"That doesn't involve me."

306
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:19,880
"It's not my fault."

307
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:22,130
You expect me to just tell myself that?

308
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:26,240
I refuse to do that.

309
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:29,760
I don't know how I'll feel when I'm dying,

310
00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:32,320
but I don't want to regret the way I lived!

311
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:36,890
Satoru.

312
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:38,440
Show him to the dorm.

313
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:42,070
Explain the security and 
everything else to him, too.

314
00:19:42,370 --> 00:19:43,280
Huh?

315
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:46,050
You pass.

316
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:48,160
Welcome to Jujutsu Tech.

317
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,270
Oh, sorry.

318
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:56,400
I forgot to release the curse.

319
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,280
This place is huge!

320
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,050
All the second- and third-years 
are out at the moment.

321
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,410
Hello!

322
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:06,090
But you'll meet them soon enough.

323
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,080
Is anybody home?

324
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,360
There aren't many of them.

325
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:10,970
But there's really no reason 
for you to fight, too, is there?

326
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:14,400
Fushiguro and I could 
retrieve Sukuna's fingers.

327
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,560
You could just wait here.

328
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:18,990
It's fine! I said I'd do it, and I'm doing it!

329
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,210
Though lazing around...

330
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:23,820
Hey.

331
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:27,960
...while Fushiguro came in all beaten up 
to bring me a finger would be a funny sight.

332
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,070
That's true.

333
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:34,240
Well, I know there's no way 
in hell you're not gonna fight.

334
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,350
Hey! You were testing me?!

335
00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:42,390
If they were that easy to find, 
we would've found them all already.

336
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,800
Some have a presence that's overwhelming.

337
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,670
Some keep very quiet.

338
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:49,390
Some have already been 
absorbed by a cursed spirit.

339
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:54,510
There's nothing more troublesome 
when it comes to searching for them.

340
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,780
But now we have you.

341
00:20:57,180 --> 00:21:02,210
The Sukuna within you will tell us where 
the fingers are to try to regain his power.

342
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:05,320
You're both vessel and locator,

343
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,800
our very own radar.

344
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:10,080
So we won't get anywhere 
without you in the field.

345
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,770
You think he's going to be that nice?

346
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:16,630
I think we can come to a 
win-win agreement there.

347
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:18,200
You're next door?

348
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,030
Oh, Fushiguro!

349
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:21,850
You look like you're doing well now.

350
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:24,360
There were plenty other 
empty rooms, weren't there?

351
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:26,860
But isn't livelier better?

352
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:28,390
I thought it'd be good for—

353
00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:29,710
Classes and missions are enough.

354
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:31,070
This was an unwelcome favor.

355
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:33,410
Wow, it's so organized.

356
00:21:33,410 --> 00:21:36,750
I just said you're unwelcome!

357
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:39,440
Well, it's all good.

358
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,660
More importantly, we're heading out tomorrow!

359
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:45,250
We're gonna go pick up the third first-year.

360
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:50,950
The train bound for Tokyo is now arriving.

361
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:54,960
For your safety, please 
stand behind the yellow line.

362
00:21:57,930 --> 00:22:00,880
It took four hours just 
to get as far as Morioka.

363
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,920
I can finally kiss that 
damn countryside goodbye.

364
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:09,550
Guess I'll be in Tokyo by the afternoon.

365
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:11,680
What should I do if I get scouted?

366
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:13,770
Like, by Stardust?

367
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:54,910
