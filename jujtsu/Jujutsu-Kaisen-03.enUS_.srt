1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:01,920
Satoru.

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:03,490
Show him to the dorm.

3
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:06,940
Explain the security and 
everything else to him, too.

4
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:07,910
Huh?

5
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:10,980
You pass.

6
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:12,960
Welcome to Jujutsu Tech.

7
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:15,820
Fushiguro!

8
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:17,720
You look like you're doing well now.

9
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:20,200
There were plenty of other 
empty rooms, weren't there?

10
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,700
But isn't livelier better?

11
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:24,320
I thought it'd be good forâ€”

12
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:25,480
Classes and missions are enough.

13
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:26,840
This was an unwelcome favor.

14
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:29,400
Wow, it's so organized.

15
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,740
I just said you're unwelcome!

16
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:35,270
Well, it's all good.

17
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:37,510
More importantly, we're heading out tomorrow!

18
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:41,050
We're gonna go pick up the third first-year.

19
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:50,660
The train bound for Shibuya and 
Shinagawa is now arriving on track 1.

20
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:55,360
For your safety, please 
stand behind the yellow line.

21
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:57,360
Saori-chan.

22
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:01,360
I'm here.

23
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:07,780
I'm in Tokyo!

24
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:12,900
How are there only three first-years? 
Isn't that too few?

25
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:17,200
Well, have you ever met anyone 
who can see curses before?

26
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,010
Nope.

27
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:23,520
That just proves how small 
a minority jujutsu sorcerers are.

28
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,270
Also, didn't you say I was the third?

29
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:29,520
Their entry was decided a while ago.

30
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:35,300
Tokyo Metropolitan
Jujutsu Technical High School

31
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:32,040
You know what our school's like.

32
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:34,260
Everyone has unique circumstances.

33
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:37,650
Sorry for the wait.

34
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:38,270
Oh?

35
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:40,710
Your uniform made it in time, I see.

36
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:42,640
Yeah, it's a perfect fit.

37
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,110
Though it's slightly 
different from Fushiguro's.

38
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:46,700
It has a hood, for one.

39
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:50,340
That's because the uniforms can 
be customized upon request.

40
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:51,020
Huh?

41
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:53,740
But I never put in any requests.

42
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:56,800
I was the one who put in the custom order.

43
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,170
Whatever, I guess.

44
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:03,640
Be careful. Gojou-sensei has a 
tendency to do things like that.

45
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:07,060
More importantly, why are 
we meeting up in Harajuku?

46
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:09,090
Because it's what she asked for.

47
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:11,160
Hey, popcorn! I want some!

48
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,740
Oh, hello there. Are you 
on the clock right now?

49
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:16,530
No, I'm not.

50
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:19,140
You see, I'm looking for potential models.

51
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:21,070
This is who I am.

52
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:22,860
Would you be interested?

53
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:24,250
I'm in a hurry right now.

54
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:26,560
Just hear me out!

55
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,630
Hey, you.

56
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:31,130
What about me?

57
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:33,650
Her?!

58
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:36,570
For the modeling gig, duh.

59
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:38,560
I'm asking what you think about me.

60
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,430
Oh, um, I'm in a hurry at the moment...

61
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,640
What the hell?

62
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,780
Don't run from me! Come out and say it!

63
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:49,580
We're about to go talk to her?

64
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:50,770
I'm sorry! Please let me go!

65
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:52,840
This is kinda embarrassing.

66
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:54,610
So are you.

67
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:55,750
Hey!

68
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:57,010
Over here!

69
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:59,980
Damn, what's up with that blindfold?

70
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:05,290
400 Yen Corner

71
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:05,290
Okay, once again.

72
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,790
Kugisaki Nobara.

73
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:10,770
Be happy, boys. 
I'm the one woman in your group.

74
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:49,160
Stare...

75
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:51,730
Episode 3: Girl of Steel

76
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,960
I'm Itadori Yuuji. I'm from Sendai.

77
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,740
Fushiguro Megumi.

78
00:04:52,650 --> 00:05:03,160
Kugisaki's POV

79
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,330
He looks like a potato.

80
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:58,340
He's definitely the type that
ate his own boogers as a kid.

81
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:00,420
And only a name here?

82
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:02,880
I can't stand high-and-mighty dudes.

83
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:06,840
I bet he likes setting 
oil-slicked gulls on fire.

84
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:11,680
I always get stuck with 
unfortunate circumstances.

85
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,440
She took one look and sighed.

86
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,170
Are we going somewhere from here?

87
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,130
We do have all three of you together.

88
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:23,180
Not to mention, two of you 
are from the countryside.

89
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,590
So of course we're going

90
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:25,930
on a tour of Tokyo!

91
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:31,440
Tokyo

92
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:29,040
Tokyo! Tokyo! Tokyo!

93
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,110
We love Tokyo!

94
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:31,610
Huh?

95
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:33,350
TDL! I want to go to TDL!

96
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:35,570
Idiot! TDL's in Chiba!

97
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:37,270
Let's go to Chinatown, Sensei!

98
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:39,340
Chinatown's in Yokohama!

99
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:41,340
Yokohama's part of Tokyo!

100
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:43,040
Don't you know that? Look at a map!

101
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,450
The hell?! Quit spouting nonsense!

102
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,450
I will now announce our destination.

103
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:51,960
Roppongi

104
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:49,470
Roppongi!

105
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:51,600
Roppongi?!

106
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,120
There's a curse here.

107
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:58,380
You liar!

108
00:05:58,380 --> 00:05:59,800
This isn't even Roppongi!

109
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,600
You were toying with us country folk!

110
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,780
There's a big cemetery nearby.

111
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:08,090
The double whammy of that and an 
abandoned building brought out a curse.

112
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:11,610
Who does he think is responsible 
for the rice he gets to eat, huh?!

113
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,570
So they really do pop up 
more often around graves?

114
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:13,640
The issue isn't the cemetery itself.

115
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:18,040
It's the fact that people 
associate cemeteries with fear.

116
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,630
Oh, it was the same 
for schools, too, wasn't it?

117
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:23,610
Hold up. He didn't even know that yet?

118
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:25,080
To be honest...

119
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:30,630
He swallowed a special-grade cursed object?!

120
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:32,910
Gross! Unbelievable!

121
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:34,360
That's so unsanitary and disgusting!

122
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,700
No way, no way, no way, no way!

123
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:36,850
What?!

124
00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:37,880
I agree with her.

125
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:40,560
I want to know what all of you are capable of.

126
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,760
Just think of this as a field test.

127
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,390
Nobara, Yuuji,

128
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:47,300
you two go exorcise the 
curse inside that building.

129
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:47,960
Geh.

130
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:52,240
Huh? But I thought only curses 
could exorcise curses, right?

131
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:54,640
I can't use any jujutsu yet.

132
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:58,000
You're basically half a curse already.

133
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,160
There's cursed energy 
flowing throughout your body.

134
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:04,150
Though controlling that energy isn't 
something you can learn overnight,

135
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:05,320
so use this.

136
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:09,470
It's the cursed tool, Slaughter Demon.

137
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:11,470
It's a weapon imbued with cursed energy.

138
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:13,140
It'll work on curses, too.

139
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,530
Lame.

140
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:19,940
Oh, one more thing.

141
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:22,860
Don't let Sukuna out.

142
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:27,520
If you use him, you'll get rid 
of all the curses nearby in a flash,

143
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,290
but you'll also drag everyone around into it.

144
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:32,390
Got it. I won't let Sukuna out.

145
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:35,870
Hurry it up.

146
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:36,740
Yeah, yeah.

147
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:38,100
Go on, now!

148
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:52,100
I think I'll go, too.

149
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:55,250
Don't push yourself. You're still recovering.

150
00:07:55,570 --> 00:07:57,780
But someone needs to keep 
an eye on Itadori, right?

151
00:07:58,190 --> 00:07:59,210
True.

152
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:03,630
But the one we're testing 
this time is Nobara.

153
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:05,190
What a pain.

154
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:08,650
Why do I have to deal with curses 
after coming all the way to Tokyo?

155
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:11,120
Huh? Didn't you come here to exorcise curses?

156
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:14,660
Let's save some time and split up.

157
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:18,600
I'll start from the top and go floor by floor. 
You start from the bottom.

158
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:21,660
Let's get this over with quick 
and grab some sushi from Ginza.

159
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:22,860
Hold on a minute.

160
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:24,630
Let's take this a bit more seriously.

161
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:26,410
Curses are dangerous, you know.

162
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:32,950
I don't wanna hear it from someone 
who was a normie until recently!

163
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:34,200
Now get moving!

164
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:39,370
Your emotions have been 
all over the place today!

165
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:41,130
This is why girls don't like you!

166
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:43,700
How did you know they don't like me?!

167
00:08:44,170 --> 00:08:47,570
Are you even popular enough to talk? Bitch.

168
00:08:58,010 --> 00:09:03,570
Do... you need... a receipt?

169
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:05,140
It's a curse!

170
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:30,170
Yeah, I can really move!

171
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:33,020
That Yuuji...

172
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:35,390
He's missing a few up here.

173
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:37,290
He has no hesitation

174
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:42,050
when it comes to killing these things 
that take the form of living creatures,

175
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:44,540
albeit bizarre-looking ones, to try to kill him.

176
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:50,460
And it's not like he's been familiar 
with curses for a long time, like you.

177
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:54,460
This is a boy who used to 
live a normal high school life.

178
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:59,410
You've seen plenty of jujutsu sorcerers,
even those with talent,

179
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:02,300
give up in frustration because
 they couldn't conquer

180
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:04,300
their fear or disgust, haven't you?

181
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:09,750
So today I want to confirm how crazy she is.

182
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:13,770
Hey, you, curse.

183
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:23,690
I mean you, mannequin in the center. 
You actually think you're hidden there?

184
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,400
If you won't come out, 
I'll just exorcise you there.

185
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:32,610
But Kugisaki has experience, right?

186
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:34,250
Little late for that now, isn't it?

187
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:37,370
Curses are born from human minds.

188
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:41,150
So their strength and numbers grow 
in proportion to the population.

189
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:02,150
Do you think Nobara understands...

190
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:08,320
that curses in Tokyo are on a different 
level than those in the countryside?

191
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:22,490
Kugisaki

192
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:29,860
Curses are born from human minds.

193
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:30,500
Broken Van

194
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:30,500
Filth

195
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:30,500
Serves you right

196
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:30,500
Go back to Tokyo

197
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:30,500
Leave

198
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:34,000
So their strength and numbers grow 
in proportion to the population.

199
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:39,560
Curses in Tokyo are on a different 
level than those in the countryside.

200
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:49,520
You might want to pull those out...

201
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:57,030
or my cursed energy will flow into you.

202
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,560
Nailed it.

203
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:20,300
A child?

204
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:24,320
Must have snuck in for some fun 
and encountered the curse.

205
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:31,750
Hey, it's all right now. Come on out.

206
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:34,980
Huh?!

207
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:43,130
I guess it's true that kids don't 
warm up to beautiful women.

208
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:44,320
Guess I'll call Itadori.

209
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,070
Wait!

210
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,310
Don't leave me here!

211
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:09,070
It's taking him hostage?

212
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:13,290
This curse has intelligence?!

213
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:17,520
When I say "level," I don't just mean 
the amount of cursed energy they have.

214
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:19,690
It's their cunning.

215
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:23,570
Monsters that have gained wisdom will 
often force cruel choices upon you...

216
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:28,290
with the weight of human lives in the balance.

217
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:30,260
Damn it, damn it, damn it!

218
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:32,240
Damn it!

219
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:35,490
This curse isn't even all that strong!

220
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:37,000
Grade 4...

221
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,450
Maybe even lower, like a low grade 3!

222
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,800
But it's aware of that!

223
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,970
That's why it chose to take a hostage!

224
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:49,470
Calm yourself down.

225
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,920
If I die, the child dies, too.

226
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:57,510
But if the child dies, I won't die.

227
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:06,400
Logically speaking, 
it's better if I survive, at least!

228
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,300
I'm unarmed.

229
00:14:13,730 --> 00:14:15,490
Let the boy go.

230
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,560
I'm such an idiot!

231
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:26,750
See? It's not letting him go at all!

232
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:34,720
I wish I could have seen 
Saori-chan one last time.

233
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:40,870
Huh? I missed?

234
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:55,310
You okay?

235
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:56,200
Uh-huh.

236
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:00,850
It's getting away!

237
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:01,920
I don't think so!

238
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:02,500
Itadori!

239
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,780
Give me that arm!

240
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:04,520
Huh?

241
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:08,480
I'll exorcise it.

242
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,330
Hold on.

243
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:12,460
A straw doll?

244
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:13,520
Creepy.

245
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,380
Straw Doll Technique:

246
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:21,580
Resonance!

247
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:31,920
Nice.

248
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,460
She's crazy, all right.

249
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,060
We won.

250
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,010
This bridge is dangerous
due to deterioration from age
and can no longer be used.

251
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:59,010
When I was in first grade,

252
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:02,990
Saori-chan moved to our village from Tokyo.

253
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,530
She was as cute as a doll,

254
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:22,550
and as kind as a nun.

255
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Sticker Book

256
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:35,870
Yet Saori-chan was 
ostracized by the villagers.

257
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:42,480
"She thinks country folk are dumb," they said,

258
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:45,480
letting themselves get paranoid,

259
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,480
We Protest the Kitagawa Highway Extension!

260
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,480
and in the end...

261
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:52,820
they drove her out.

262
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:56,490
Home for Sale

263
00:16:56,490 --> 00:17:00,490
Broken Van

264
00:16:56,490 --> 00:17:00,490
Filth

265
00:16:56,490 --> 00:17:00,490
Serves you right

266
00:16:56,490 --> 00:17:00,490
Go back to Tokyo

267
00:16:56,490 --> 00:17:00,490
Leave

268
00:16:56,830 --> 00:16:59,200
Calling it sickening wouldn't be enough.

269
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:06,760
She brought all these homemade 
sweets I'd never heard of and said,

270
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:11,790
"The ones from the bakery are even better," 
with a smile as she treated me to them.

271
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:18,260
This bridge is dangerous
due to deterioration from age
and can no longer be used.

272
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:19,980
If I had stayed in that village...

273
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:23,840
This is why I told you

274
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:26,500
it's dangerous to go alone and 
you need to take it seriously!

275
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:29,330
You never said it was dangerous to go alone!

276
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:30,990
I... didn't?!

277
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:34,950
And what have you been eating that lets you 
punch through a wall with your bare hand?!

278
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:36,960
It wasn't reinforced concrete!

279
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,900
Even if it was, that'd still be 
impossible for most people!

280
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,790
Most people?

281
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:47,220
You know, you've asked me 
plenty of questions already,

282
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:49,440
but why did you come to Jujutsu Tech?

283
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,720
Why?

284
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,760
Because I hate the countryside,

285
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,930
and I wanted to live in Tokyo!

286
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:03,870
This was the only way I could move to the city 
without having to worry about money!

287
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:06,220
You can risk your life over that?

288
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:10,850
I can.

289
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,280
After all, it means being true to myself.

290
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:24,410
If I had stayed in that village, 
I'd be as good as dead.

291
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:38,220
Saori-chan, I made it to Tokyo.

292
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,390
If we ever meet here,

293
00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:48,980
take me to that bakery you mentioned.

294
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:57,680
So as far as that goes, I'm grateful to you, too.

295
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,010
There wouldn't have been

296
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:02,900
a bright future if I had died or 
I had been the only one to survive.

297
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:04,930
Thanks.

298
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:10,040
Well, having a more serious reason 
doesn't make anyone better than the rest.

299
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,770
Okay, I've given you my 
thanks, so that's all over!

300
00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:14,720
We're even now!

301
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,150
What's wrong with her?

302
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:20,280
I live over there! Thanks again!

303
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:26,560
Did you know I get into a 
foul mood when I'm hungry?

304
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,720
When are you not in a foul mood?

305
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:32,400
Good Joseph!

306
00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:34,820
We made sure the kid got home.

307
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:38,450
Now shall we go grab some food?

308
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,690
Steak!

309
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:41,990
Sushi!

310
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:45,200
Leave it all to me!

311
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,050
And you, Megumi?

312
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:51,130
Okay, let's go.

313
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:58,030
Oh, I forgot about my 
biggest haul of the day.

314
00:19:58,290 --> 00:20:00,550
Hey, you, go fetch my things.

315
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:01,130
Harajuku

316
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:01,130
Coin Locker

317
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:02,550
Huh? Why should I do it?

318
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:04,270
I thought we were even.

319
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:07,350
We won thanks to my cursed energy. 
Got a problem with that?

320
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:09,670
What about my raw strength?

321
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:11,950
Your monstrous power 
from eating weird shit?

322
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:13,580
It's not just that!

323
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:14,790
Right, Fushiguro?

324
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:18,060
Huh? What's the matter, Fushiguro?

325
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:18,830
Nothing.

326
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:20,680
He's pouting because he 
didn't get to join in.

327
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:23,090
What a child.

328
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:36,920

330
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:36,920
West Tokyo City
Eishuu Juvenile Detention Center

331
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:35,130
West Tokyo City,

332
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:36,920
Eishuu Juvenile Detention Center.

333
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:42,420
In the sky above the exercise yard

334
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:42,420
In the sky above the exercise yard.

335
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:45,650
Hey...

336
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:48,420
What's that?

337
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:50,530
What?

338
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:59,940
Unnamed Apparition of Potential Special Grade

339
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:54,500
Unnamed Apparition 
of Potential Special Grade.

340
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:59,940
Its curse womb was witnessed by several non-jujutsu sorcerers.

341
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:59,090
Its curse womb was witnessed 
by several non-jujutsu sorcerers.

342
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:02,370
That up there! Looks like an egg.

343
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:04,110
What are you talking about?

344
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:10,700
Due to the emergency nature,

345
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,320
Due to the emergency nature,

346
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:10,700
three Jujutsu Tech first-years were dispatched to the scene,

347
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:10,080
three Jujutsu Tech first-years 
were dispatched to the scene,

348
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:13,200
and one died.

349
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:14,960
and one died.

350
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:47,210
Juju Stroll

351
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,730
Itadori. I'm going with paper.

352
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,450
Rock-paper-scissors!

353
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,080
Oh, yeah!

354
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,660
Sushi, huh? Guess we can go 
to the usual place in Ginza.

355
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:58,860
Ginza, yahoo!

356
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:00,360
I want revolving sushi!

357
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,190
Ugh! Itadori, you're such a...

358
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:05,140
Ugh! Fushiguro, say something to him!

359
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:07,150
I'd rather get something 
that tastes good if we're going.

360
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:08,380
Gojou-sensei's paying, anyway.

361
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:09,890
Revolving sushi is its own thing,

362
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:12,700
just like how yakisoba and instant
yakisoba are different things!

363
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:14,510
And I want to eat sushi.

364
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:17,440
Sushi's just a meal, but 
revolving sushi's a leisure activity!

365
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,370
Like a theme park! Or TDL!

366
00:23:19,370 --> 00:23:21,680
Also, Kugisaki, you said you 
were from the country too,

367
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,520
so have you ever been to 
a revolving sushi place?!

368
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:25,630
My favorite is Sushi Go,

369
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:27,760
but I'd go with Splendid Sushi 
for someone's first time.

370
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,170
You get it, Sensei!

371
00:23:29,170 --> 00:23:30,510
Hey, no one's said we're going yet.

372
00:23:30,890 --> 00:23:32,420
Kugisaki, listen closely.

373
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,010
At Splendid Sushi...

374
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:36,780
the sushi comes to you on a bullet train.

375
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:38,260
Wha?!

376
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:41,470
Driver, this girl's never 
had revolving sushi before.

377
00:23:41,210 --> 00:23:44,940
*Please ride in cars properly and safely.

378
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:44,480
Take us to the Splendid Sushi with the 
huge-ass parking lot along the interstate!

379
00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:54,950
